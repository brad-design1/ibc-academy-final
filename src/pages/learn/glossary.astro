  { term: 'Infinite Banking Concept (IBC)', definition: 'A strategy developed by Nelson Nash for recapturing the banking function in your financial life using dividend-paying whole life insurance from a mutual company.' },
  { term: 'Banking Function', definition: 'The process of storing, lending, and earning interest on capital. Every financial transaction involves the banking function — the question is who controls it.' },
  { term: 'Whole Life Insurance', definition: 'A permanent life insurance product with guaranteed cash value growth, level premiums, and (from mutual companies) dividend participation.' },
  { term: 'Cash Value', definition: 'The savings component of a whole life insurance policy. It grows guaranteed each year and can be accessed via policy loans.' },
  { term: 'Policy Loan', definition: 'A loan from the insurance company using your cash value as collateral. Crucially, your cash value continues to earn dividends during the loan.' },
  { term: 'Paid-Up Additions (PUA)', definition: 'Additional premium payments that purchase small blocks of fully paid-up insurance, dramatically accelerating cash value growth.' },
  { term: 'Mutual Company', definition: 'An insurance company owned by its policyholders (not shareholders). Profits are returned to policyholders as dividends.' },
  { term: 'Dividend', definition: 'A return of excess premium paid to policyholders by a mutual insurance company. Not guaranteed, but major mutuals have paid them for 100+ consecutive years.' },
  { term: 'Non-Direct Recognition', definition: 'A company practice where policy loans do not affect dividend calculations — meaning your full cash value earns dividends even while a loan is outstanding.' },
  { term: 'Direct Recognition', definition: 'A company practice where outstanding policy loans may affect (typically reduce) the dividend credited to the loaned portion of cash value.' },
  { term: 'MEC (Modified Endowment Contract)', definition: 'A life insurance policy that has been overfunded beyond IRS limits (7-pay test). MEC policies lose some tax advantages, which is why proper policy design avoids this.' },
  { term: 'Velocity of Money', definition: 'The concept that money can work in multiple places simultaneously. In IBC, your cash value earns dividends while your loaned capital is deployed elsewhere.' },
  { term: 'Becoming Your Own Banker (BYOB)', definition: 'The foundational book by R. Nelson Nash (first published 2000) that introduces and explains the Infinite Banking Concept.' },
  { term: 'Austrian Economics', definition: 'A school of economic thought emphasizing individual action, sound money, and free markets. Provides the philosophical foundation for many IBC principles.' },
  { term: 'Human Life Value', definition: 'The economic concept that a person\'s earning potential over their lifetime represents their most valuable asset — and the basis for proper life insurance amounts.' },
