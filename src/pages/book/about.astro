          <p>
            R. Nelson Nash wrote "Becoming Your Own Banker" after decades of practicing what he preached. A forestry consultant by trade, Nash discovered the power of dividend-paying whole life insurance not through financial theory, but through solving a real problem: how to finance logging equipment without giving away control to banks.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            What he discovered changed everything. The book distills that discovery into approximately 90 pages of paradigm-shifting content.

          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Read It Twice</h2>
          <p>
            Nelson Nash himself recommended reading the book at least twice. The first read plants the seed. The second read — after you've had time to think about it — is where the real understanding begins.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Don't rush it. Let the concepts challenge your assumptions. If something seems wrong or confusing, sit with it. The paradigm shift Nash describes requires unlearning before you can learn.

          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-4">A Word of Caution</h2>
          <p>
            Many people read this book and then try to implement IBC on their own, or worse, work with an agent who doesn't truly understand the concept. The result is often a policy that doesn't perform as expected.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            IBC is simple in concept but requires precise execution. That's why working with an Authorized IBC Practitioner — someone trained directly through the Nelson Nash Institute — matters.
