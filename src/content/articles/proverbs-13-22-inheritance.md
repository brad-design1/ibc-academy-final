# Proverbs 13:22 — Building an Inheritance

*"A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children."* — Proverbs 13:22

That's not a suggestion. It's not a nice idea. In the context of Proverbs, it's a marker of wisdom — a distinguishing characteristic of the person who understands how the world actually works.

But here's what most people miss: this verse isn't primarily about accumulation. It's about **transfer**. It's about building something that outlasts you and reaches beyond your immediate horizon.

That requires a different kind of thinking.

## The Difference Between Wealth and a System

Most financial planning focuses on accumulation. Save enough. Grow it fast enough. Hope it lasts long enough. The goal is a number — a pile of assets you can draw down in retirement until you die.

There's nothing inherently wrong with that goal. But notice what it doesn't address: your children's children.

An inheritance that reaches to the third generation can't be a pile. Piles get divided. Piles get spent. Piles get eroded by taxes, lawsuits, and the spending habits of heirs who didn't build them.

What Proverbs 13:22 implies is something more durable — a **system** that creates value across generations, not just a sum that gets split at death.

Nelson Nash, the creator of the Infinite Banking Concept, understood this distinction. In his book *Becoming Your Own Banker*, he dedicated an entire section to what he called "an even distribution of age classes" — a framework for thinking about family wealth not in terms of a single lifetime, but across multiple generations.

His inspiration? Forestry.

## Thinking Like a Forester

Nash was a forester before he was an insurance agent. He thought in decades. He thought in rotations. He understood that a healthy forest isn't one age — it's a distribution of ages, with young trees growing while mature trees are harvested, in a continuous cycle.

His insight was that a family's financial system should work the same way.

Instead of one person building a retirement account and then depleting it, Nash proposed a structure where **each generation funds policies for the next generation**, creating overlapping systems of capital that compound across time.

Here's how it might look in practice:

A grandparent starts a policy on a grandchild at birth. They fund it for 20-22 years with consistent premium payments. By the time that grandchild reaches adulthood, they have meaningful cash value — capital they own and control, with decades of compounding ahead of them.

But here's where it gets interesting: that grandchild, now an adult with their own children, does the same thing for the next generation. And the pattern continues.

What you've created isn't just a death benefit that passes at the end of life. You've created an **institution** — a family banking system that perpetuates itself.

Nash called this "perpetual motion in your family's financial world."

## The Numbers That Matter

Let's make this concrete.

Using the illustration from Nash's book (adjusted for conceptual clarity), imagine a grandparent funding a policy on a grandchild from age 0 to 22, contributing a modest amount each year — say, $2,000.

By age 22, that grandchild has approximately **$100,000 in cash value**. Not in a trust they can't touch. Not in an account with restrictions and penalties. Cash value they own and control, available for education, a business, a down payment, or simply to let compound.

Now here's the long-range view: if that policy continues to grow — even with no additional premium payments after age 22 — the cash value by age 70 could exceed **$4 million**. At that point, the grandchild (now a retiree) could take distributions of around **$225,000 per year** on a tax-advantaged basis, while still maintaining a death benefit that passes to the next generation.

Run that pattern across three or four generations, and you're not talking about wealth. You're talking about a **legacy**.

## What You're Actually Passing Down

Money is not the most valuable thing you can leave your grandchildren.

Read that again. Money, by itself, doesn't solve problems. It amplifies whatever is already there. Hand a pile of cash to someone who doesn't understand capital, and it will be gone within a decade — often faster.

What makes the IBC approach different is that the policy is **educational by design**. You can't use it well without understanding it. The grandchild who inherits a funded policy also inherits the responsibility to learn:

- How the banking function works
- Why cash value matters
- How to take a policy loan and repay it honestly
- Why controlling the flow of capital is more valuable than chasing returns

In other words, you're not just passing down money. You're passing down a **framework for thinking about money**. That's the inheritance that compounds — not just financially, but intellectually and spiritually.

Nash often said that the infinite banking concept isn't about the policy. The policy is just the vehicle. The concept is about reclaiming the banking function — the flow of capital through your life — and keeping it within your family instead of handing it to institutions that profit from your transactions.

When you teach that to your children, and they teach it to theirs, you've fulfilled something much deeper than a bequest. You've passed down wisdom.

## The Proverbs 13:22 Problem

Here's the uncomfortable truth: most people can't fulfill Proverbs 13:22 under the standard financial model.

The standard model says: save into a tax-deferred retirement account, don't touch it until 59½, draw it down in retirement, and hope you don't outlive it.

That model is designed for one person's lifetime. It has no mechanism for reaching your children's children. In fact, the rules actively discourage it — early withdrawal penalties, required minimum distributions, estate taxes, and income taxes on inherited retirement accounts all work against multi-generational transfer.

If you've ever wondered why generational wealth seems to concentrate in certain families while others start over every generation, this is part of the answer. The standard model treats wealth as a personal resource to be consumed, not a family institution to be maintained.

IBC offers an alternative structure — one where capital can be accessed during your lifetime **and** transferred at death **and** continued by the next generation without starting over.

That's not a product feature. That's a philosophy.

## Who This Is For

Not everyone should pursue this path. Nash was clear about that, and so am I.

This approach is for people who:

- **Think in decades, not quarters.** If you're optimizing for next year's returns, you'll be frustrated by the patience IBC requires.
- **Value control over performance.** The goal isn't to beat the market. The goal is to own the banking function in your family's financial life.
- **Have consistent income and the discipline to commit premium payments.** You can't build a banking system with sporadic contributions.
- **Want to leave something durable.** If your plan ends with your own retirement, this isn't necessary. If your plan extends to your grandchildren, it's worth considering.

If that describes you, Proverbs 13:22 isn't a distant aspiration. It's a design specification.

## A Different Kind of Starting Point

Most financial conversations start with "What's your retirement number?" or "What rate of return do you need?"

The IBC conversation starts somewhere else: "Who is currently profiting from the banking function in your life — and could that be your family instead?"

When you finance a car, someone profits from the interest. When you pay a mortgage, someone profits from the interest. When you use credit cards, someone profits from the interest. That's the banking function. It's happening whether you're aware of it or not.

The question is whether that profit stays with institutions or circulates within your own family system.

Build the system. Fund it consistently. Teach your children how it works. Watch them teach theirs.

That's how you leave an inheritance to your children's children.

Not through luck. Not through windfalls. Through wisdom applied across time.
