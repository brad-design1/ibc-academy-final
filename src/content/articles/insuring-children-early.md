# Insuring Your Children: Starting Early

One of the least understood applications of the Infinite Banking Concept is also one of the most powerful: starting whole life insurance policies on children and grandchildren.

Most people hear "life insurance on a child" and immediately ask: why would anyone insure a child? They don't have income to replace. They're not supporting a family. The question reveals a deep misunderstanding — because the death benefit isn't the primary purpose. The purpose is to **guarantee insurability**, capture **60+ years of uninterrupted compounding**, and give your child or grandchild **access to capital** at the exact moment in life when access to capital matters most.

Nelson Nash dedicated an entire section of *Becoming Your Own Banker* to intergenerational wealth transfer. His recommendation was clear: if you understand what's going on with a dividend-paying whole life policy structured for banking, you should insure children as early as possible. Not because you expect them to die. Because you want to give them a six-decade head start.

## Guaranteeing Insurability

Here's a reality most parents don't consider until it's too late: **insurability is not permanent**.

Your child is healthy today. They're young, active, and have no medical history. The underwriting process for a child's policy is straightforward — often just a few simple questions. The premiums are remarkably low because actuarially, the risk is minimal.

Now fast-forward 25 years. Your child is 30. They've developed a chronic condition — Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disorder, a heart murmur discovered during a routine physical. Or they've taken up a high-risk hobby. Or they work in a hazardous profession. Suddenly, they're rated — meaning they'll pay significantly higher premiums — or worse, they're uninsurable entirely.

This happens more often than you'd think. A single diagnosis can eliminate someone's access to life insurance for life.

When you start a policy on a child at age 2, 5, or 10, you lock in their insurability at that moment. The policy exists. It's in force. It will continue as long as premiums are paid — regardless of what happens to the child's health later. You've taken the risk of uninsurability completely off the table.

And there's a secondary benefit: most properly designed policies include riders that allow the insured to **purchase additional insurance** at key life events (marriage, birth of a child, etc.) without additional medical underwriting. You're not just locking in today's insurability — you're guaranteeing future options.

## The Power of 60+ Years of Compounding

Time is the single most valuable input in any compounding system. Not rate of return. Not contribution amount. **Time**.

Consider two scenarios:

**Scenario A:** A 35-year-old starts a whole life policy on himself. He funds it for 30 years. At age 65, he has a substantial pool of capital — let's say $500,000 in cash value. That's excellent. He's built a real asset.

**Scenario B:** That same person's parents started a policy on him at age 5. They funded it for 18 years — $2,000 per year — and then stopped. They transferred ownership to him at 23. He never paid another premium. But because that policy had been compounding since age 5, it had a 60-year runway instead of a 30-year runway.

The numbers from Nash's book illustrate this starkly. In one example, a grandparent puts $2,000 per year into a policy on a grandchild from birth to age 22. Total premiums: $44,000. By age 22, the grandchild has roughly **$100,000 in cash value**. That's already more than double the premiums paid — before the child has contributed a single dollar.

But here's where time shows its power: if that policy is left alone — no additional premiums, no loans, nothing — the cash value at age 70 grows to approximately **$4 million**. From $44,000 in total contributions. The grandchild could take over $200,000 per year in tax-advantaged retirement income while the death benefit continues to grow.

This isn't investing genius. It's not market timing. It's the mathematics of uninterrupted compounding over six decades. The earlier you start, the longer the runway, the larger the outcome.

## Access to Capital at Age 18

One of the most practical benefits of starting a policy on a child is what it provides when they become a young adult.

A properly designed policy started at age 5 and funded at $2,000 per year will have approximately **$40,000-50,000 in cash value** by the time the child turns 18. That's capital the child — or the parent who still owns the policy — can access for any purpose:

- **College expenses** (if they choose to attend)
- **Trade school or vocational training**
- **Starting a business**
- **First car purchase**
- **Security deposit on an apartment**
- **Emergency fund**

The key word is **any purpose**. There are no restrictions. No government telling you what qualifies. No penalties if your child decides college isn't for them and wants to start a plumbing business instead.

Compare this to most vehicles parents use to save for their children's future. The money is either locked up, restricted, or exposed to market volatility. A whole life policy's cash value is guaranteed to be there — growing every year, accessible via policy loan at any time.

And here's the part most people miss: when your child takes a policy loan to buy a car or start a business, **the full cash value keeps compounding**. The insurance company lends money from its general account, using the death benefit as collateral. The cash value stays intact, earning guaranteed growth and participating in dividends. Your child uses the money AND keeps it growing at the same time.

This is what Nash called "the velocity of money" — having your capital work in multiple places simultaneously.

## IBC Policies vs. 529 Plans: An Honest Comparison

Many parents saving for their children's future default to a 529 plan. It's the government-approved vehicle for education savings, and it does have legitimate benefits. But the tradeoffs are significant, and most financial advisors never explain them clearly.

Let me lay out the comparison honestly.

### What 529 Plans Do Well

529 plans offer **tax-free growth** on investments when the money is used for qualified education expenses. In some states, contributions are tax-deductible. If your child attends college, uses the full balance for tuition, room, board, and books, and nothing goes wrong — it works as advertised.

Recent changes (effective 2024-2026) have expanded flexibility somewhat. You can now roll unused funds into a Roth IRA (with limitations), and the definition of qualified expenses has broadened slightly.

### The Restrictions That Matter

Here's what 529 proponents don't emphasize:

**The money is controlled by the government's definition of "qualified expenses."** If your child decides college isn't for them, you have two options: pay a 10% federal penalty plus income taxes on the earnings, or transfer the funds to another family member who will use it for education. You cannot use the money to start a business. You cannot use it to buy equipment. You cannot use it for a down payment on a house.

**Market risk.** Unlike whole life cash value, 529 balances fluctuate with market conditions. Parents who saved diligently for 18 years watched their balances drop 30-40% in 2008 — right when their children needed the money for freshman year. The same thing happened in 2022. There's no guarantee your balance will be there when you need it.

**Penalties for non-qualified use.** If you withdraw money for anything other than qualified education expenses, you pay ordinary income tax on the earnings plus a 10% federal penalty. Some states add additional penalties. The government decides what's "qualified" — and that definition can change.

**Loss of control.** Once money goes into a 529, it's earmarked. You can change beneficiaries within the family, but you cannot simply redirect the capital to whatever opportunity emerges. You've surrendered flexibility for a tax benefit.

### What a Whole Life Policy Offers Instead

A whole life policy structured for IBC provides a fundamentally different structure:

**No restrictions on use.** Policy loans can be used for any purpose — education, business, cars, emergencies, opportunities. The insurance company doesn't ask what you're using the money for. You don't file paperwork justifying the expense. You borrow against your death benefit and use the capital however you see fit.

**Guaranteed growth.** Cash value increases every year. The insurance company guarantees it contractually. Market crashes don't reduce your balance. Your child's college fund doesn't drop 35% the year before freshman year.

**Tax-advantaged access.** Policy loans are not taxable events. You access capital without triggering income tax or penalties. When structured properly, the death benefit passes to beneficiaries income-tax-free.

**Uninterrupted compounding.** When you borrow from a 529, that money stops growing. When you take a policy loan, your cash value continues to earn guaranteed interest and dividends. The money works in two places at once.

**Lifetime utility.** A 529 is designed to be depleted. A whole life policy is designed to last a lifetime — accumulating during working years, providing access to capital during life, and transferring wealth at death. Your child doesn't just get college money. They get a banking system.

### The Tradeoff

There is one honest tradeoff: in the early years of a whole life policy, cash value growth is slower than what you might achieve in a 529 invested aggressively in the market. If you're absolutely certain your child will attend college, will use every dollar for qualified expenses, and nothing will change in 18 years — a 529 may produce a higher balance.

But how many parents can make that guarantee? How many 5-year-olds grow up to follow the exact path their parents predicted?

The IBC approach trades maximum theoretical growth for **guaranteed growth, flexibility, control, and lifetime utility**. For most families, that tradeoff is worth it.

## What Nelson Nash Said About College

Nash dedicated several pages of *Becoming Your Own Banker* to what he called "the monetary value of a college degree." His perspective was shaped by decades of observation and the recognition that the university system has become deeply intertwined with government funding.

His point wasn't that education is worthless — far from it. His point was that the **financing structure** of modern higher education transfers massive amounts of capital from families to institutions, lenders, and government programs. Student loan debt has exploded precisely because government-backed lending removes market discipline. Universities raise tuition because students can always borrow more. The result is a generation saddled with hundreds of thousands in debt before they earn their first real paycheck.

Nash's alternative: instead of sending $20,000 per year to a university for four years ($80,000 total), put that same money into a properly structured policy. By the time that money has compounded for 40-50 years, the cash value dwarfs what any degree might have earned — and the policy owner has access to capital throughout, not just a diploma and debt.

This isn't an argument against education. It's an argument for **controlling the capital** and making decisions that serve your family's actual circumstances rather than following a prescribed path because "that's what you're supposed to do."

Some children will thrive in university. Some will thrive in trades. Some will start businesses. Some will pursue paths that don't exist yet. A 529 plan assumes one outcome. A whole life policy funds any outcome.

## Building the Family Banking System

The most powerful application of insuring children is when it becomes part of a broader **family banking system** — the "even distribution of age classes" Nash borrowed from his years in forestry.

Picture a timber operation: you own land and grow trees on a 40-year rotation. Every year you harvest one compartment and replant it. After 40 years, you have trees at every stage of growth — some ready to cut, others just saplings. Income comes in every year. No single-point failures.

Nash applied this logic to a family banking system. Parents have their policies — capitalized, mature, producing cash value. Children have smaller policies — recently started, building foundations. Grandchildren have policies started at birth — tiny premiums, enormous compounding runways.

Each generation funds the next. Each generation receives a system that was started decades before they were born. The premiums one generation pays become the capital the next generation deploys.

This isn't about getting rich quick. It's about building an institution that compounds across generations — a family bank that operates outside the volatility of markets, the restrictions of government programs, and the predatory terms of third-party lenders.

## Getting Started

If you're considering starting a policy on a child or grandchild, here's what matters:

**The policy must be designed for banking, not death benefit.** Most whole life policies sold to parents are designed wrong — maximizing death benefit, minimizing cash value. An IBC-designed policy emphasizes paid-up additions (PUA) and minimizes base premium to put more money to work immediately.

**Start as early as possible.** The younger the child, the lower the premium and the longer the compounding runway. A policy started at age 2 has a fundamentally different trajectory than one started at age 12.

**Ownership matters.** Typically, a parent or grandparent owns the policy initially. They retain control of the cash value and make decisions about loans and transfers. Ownership can be transferred later — at age 18, 21, 25, or whenever the child demonstrates financial maturity.

**This is a commitment.** Like any capitalization process, early years require consistent funding. Premiums must be paid. If you're not prepared to fund the policy for 10-20 years, the timing may not be right.

**Read the book.** *Becoming Your Own Banker* by R. Nelson Nash. The section on intergenerational wealth (pages 71-74) addresses this topic directly. Understanding the concept is not optional.

## The Real Gift

Most parents think the financial gift to their children is the money itself — the college fund, the inheritance, the down payment assistance.

But the real gift is something deeper: **giving your child a system for thinking about money**.

A child who grows up understanding the banking function — who sees their parents taking policy loans instead of bank loans, who learns to repay with interest to their own system, who inherits a policy with decades of built-in capital — that child enters adulthood with a completely different relationship to finance than their peers.

They don't see banks as the only option. They don't see debt as inevitable. They understand that interest can flow to them instead of away from them. They have capital when they need it and the knowledge to use it wisely.

Nash called this "privatizing the banking function within your family." The policies are the vehicle. The education is the inheritance that really matters.

That's what starting early makes possible.
