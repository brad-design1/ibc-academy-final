# What Is the Infinite Banking Concept?

The Infinite Banking Concept (IBC) is a strategy developed by Nelson Nash, detailed in his book *Becoming Your Own Banker*. At its core, IBC is about **recapturing the banking function** in your personal financial life.

## The Banking Function

Every time you make a major purchase — a car, equipment, education, real estate — you finance it. The question isn't *whether* you finance it, but **who gets the banking function**: a traditional bank, or you?

When you use a bank's money, you pay interest to them. When you use your own money (even cash), you lose the interest you *could* have earned. Either way, there's a cost. Nelson Nash called this the ** â€” economic problem."**

## The Process, Not the Product

IBC is a **process** — not a product. The vehicle used to implement this process is a specially designed **dividend-paying whole life insurance policy** from a mutual insurance company. But the policy is just the tool. The concept is about:

1. **Creating your own banking system** — Building a pool of capital that you control
2. **Recapturing interest** — Paying yourself back with interest instead of paying a bank
3. **The velocity of money** — Keeping your money in motion and working in multiple places simultaneously
4. **Thinking long-term** — Building a multi-generational wealth strategy

## Why Whole Life Insurance?

The whole life policy is the ideal vehicle for IBC because of its unique characteristics:

- **Guaranteed cash value growth** — Your money grows every year, guaranteed
- **Dividend participation** — Mutual companies share profits with policyholders
- **Tax advantages** — Cash value grows tax-deferred; policy loans are not taxable events
- **Uninterrupted compounding** — When you take a policy loan, your cash value continues to earn dividends as if you never touched it
- **Death benefit** — The ultimate self-completion mechanism

## Common Misconceptions

** â€” It's just whole life insurance."** No — IBC is a process. The policy is the vehicle, not the concept.

** â€” You can do this with any savings account."** Not quite. No savings account offers uninterrupted compounding during loans, tax-free access, and a death benefit.

** â€” It's too good to be true."** IBC isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires discipline, patience, and a long-term mindset. It's Nelson Nash's observation about how money works, applied consistently.
