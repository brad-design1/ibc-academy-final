The statistics are brutal. And consistent.

**Ninety percent of wealthy families lose their fortune by the third generation.** Seventy percent squander it by the second.

This isn't speculation. It's documented reality across cultures, across centuries, across economic systems. The wealthy family's children graduate to poverty with remarkable predictability.

"Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times." The same pattern plays out with family wealth — generation after generation, across every culture. The words differ. The pattern doesn't.

Why does this happen? And more importantly, how do you stop it?

The answer lies in understanding the difference between **making money** and **understanding money**.

## The Knowledge Gap That Kills Wealth

Most parents who build wealth focus on the accumulation. They master their profession. They build businesses. They accumulate assets.

But they never teach their children **how money actually works**.

Ryan Griggs explains this phenomenon in his research on **financial education versus financial understanding**. "People confuse knowing about money with knowing money itself," he writes. "They teach their children about compound interest but never show them the banking function. They explain stocks and bonds but never demonstrate capital formation."

The result? Children inherit money without inheriting the understanding that created it.

They receive the fruit but never learn how to tend the tree. When the fruit runs out, they're left with no way to grow more.

**Nelson Nash understood this problem intimately.** His solution wasn't just about building wealth. It was about building systems that taught wealth principles to the next generation automatically.

## The Traditional Approach Fails

Watch how most wealthy parents approach financial education with their children:

They open a savings account. "Look how your money grows with compound interest."

They buy stocks in the child's name. "You're learning to invest."

They teach budgeting. "Track where every dollar goes."

All of this misses the fundamental point.

**Children learn by observing systems, not by listening to lectures.** They absorb how their parents actually handle money, not what their parents say about money.

If the child watches their parents take out car loans, they learn that borrowing from banks is normal.

If they watch their parents obsess over investment returns, they learn that wealth comes from gambling in markets.

If they watch their parents pay mortgage payments for thirty years, they learn that debt is permanent.

The child's **financial operating system** gets programmed by what they observe daily. Not by what gets explained occasionally.

This is why wealthy families lose their money. The parents accumulate wealth through business skills or professional expertise. But their daily money habits teach their children to consume wealth, not create it.

## What Nash Taught His Children

Nash approached this differently. He didn't teach his children about money. **He included them in his banking system.**

When Nash's children needed car financing, they didn't go to Chase or Ford Credit. They borrowed from the family banking system â€” the whole life policies Nash had established.

When they made payments, they weren't enriching some distant bank. They were capitalizing their own family's pool of wealth.

The children learned the banking function by **participating in it**. Not by studying it.

They experienced how interest flows. They witnessed how capital compounds. They understood the difference between being the bank and being the customer.

**Most importantly, they learned that their family controlled their own banking function.**

This knowledge becomes generational. It doesn't depend on individual talent or market conditions. It depends on understanding how money moves and who controls that movement.

## The Banking Function as Education

Consider what happens when you establish a family banking system through properly designed whole life policies:

Your 16-year-old needs a car. Instead of taking them to a dealer who pushes financing, you show them the policy loan option.

"Here's $15,000 from our family bank. You'll pay it back at 5% interest. But here's the key: **the interest comes back to us**. You're not making some banker wealthy. You're capitalizing your own family's system."

The child learns several lessons simultaneously:

**Capital has cost.** Money isn't free. Someone always pays interest.

**Interest direction matters.** The question isn't whether you pay interest. It's who receives it.

**Control creates options.** When you control capital, you control timing, terms, and consequences.

**Systems compound.** Each repayment strengthens the system for the next need.

This education happens through experience. The child doesn't memorize principles. They live them.

When that same child reaches 25 and needs business startup capital, they understand the process. They've participated in it for years.

## The Compound Effect of Knowledge

Traditional financial education teaches children to be **consumers of financial services**. They learn to shop for the best rates, the best funds, the best loans.

Nash's approach teaches children to be **providers of financial services** â€” to themselves and their families.

The child who grows up in a family banking environment asks different questions:

Instead of "What's the rate of return on this investment?" they ask "How does this strengthen our capital position?"

Instead of "Should we take out a loan for this purchase?" they ask "How do we finance this ourselves?"

Instead of "How do we minimize taxes this year?" they ask "How do we build systems that work regardless of tax policy?"

**This shift in thinking is worth more than any inheritance.**

The child who inherits $1 million but thinks like a consumer will lose that money. The child who inherits $100,000 but thinks like a banker will build wealth.

Knowledge compounds faster than money. And it's harder to lose.

## The Practical Steps

Implementing this approach requires intentional action:

**Start with yourself.** As the first generation practicing IBC, establish policies on yourself first. As you reach maximum insurability and your cash flow permits, expand to policies on your children. You maintain ownership and control. They benefit from death benefit protection and cash value growth.

**Use the system for real purchases.** When children need cars, education funding, or business capital, use policy loans instead of external financing. Show them the mechanics.

**Explain the flow.** Help them understand where the money comes from, where it goes, and why this approach differs from traditional borrowing.

**Graduate ownership gradually.** As children demonstrate understanding and responsibility, begin transferring policy ownership. They move from beneficiaries to owners to teachers.

**Document the process.** Keep records showing how the system works, what decisions were made, and why. This becomes the family's financial operating manual.

The goal isn't just to build wealth. It's to build **wealth-building knowledge** that transfers to the next generation.

## Why Most Families Miss This

The traditional financial world doesn't teach the banking function because it profits from your ignorance of it.

**Banks want you to be a customer, not a competitor.** Investment firms want you dependent on their products. Insurance companies want you confused about how their products actually work.

Financial education usually means product education. Learning which funds to buy. Which cards offer the best rewards. Which loans have the lowest rates.

Nash taught something different: **Learn to perform the banking function yourself.**

This knowledge threatens every institution that profits from your dependence on them.

It's also harder to teach because it requires understanding systems, not just products. It requires patience, not just intelligence. It requires thinking generationally, not just annually.

**Most parents take the easier path.** They outsource their children's financial education to schools, books, or financial advisors. They hope someone else will teach what they never learned themselves.

The children inherit money but not the mindset. The wealth disappears predictably.

## The Biblical Foundation

Proverbs 13:22 states: "A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children."

Note what this doesn't say. It doesn't mention leaving money to your children. It mentions leaving an inheritance to your **children's children**.

**This suggests a multi-generational perspective.** The inheritance isn't just wealth. It's the system that creates and preserves wealth across generations.

The Hebrew word for inheritance"*nachalah* â€” implies something passed down that continues to produce value. Not a one-time transfer. An ongoing resource.

When you teach your children the banking function, you're creating *nachalah*. A system that works for them, their children, and their children's children.

The knowledge becomes the inheritance. The money becomes secondary.

## Breaking the Cycle

The wealthy family's destruction follows a predictable pattern:

**Generation One** builds wealth through business skills or professional expertise.

**Generation Two** inherits wealth but not the skills that created it. They focus on preserving rather than understanding.

**Generation Three** grows up with wealth but no understanding of how it was created or why it matters. They treat it as an endless resource.

**The wealth disappears.**

Breaking this cycle requires changing the education pattern:

**Generation One** builds wealth AND teaches the banking function.

**Generation Two** inherits wealth AND the understanding that sustains it.

**Generation Three** grows up operating wealth systems, not just consuming wealth products.

**The wealth grows across generations.**

This approach requires you to become a teacher, not just an accumulator. You must learn systems well enough to demonstrate them. You must think generationally, not just personally.

**Most importantly, you must start now.**

## The Time Factor

Every year you delay teaching your children the banking function is a year of education lost.

A 6-year-old who watches you make policy loan repayments learns that money comes from systems, not from magic.

A 16-year-old who finances their first car through family banking learns how interest flows work.

A 26-year-old who uses the system to capitalize their business understands capital formation at a visceral level.

**Each experience builds on the previous one.** By the time your children reach full adulthood, they've participated in a functioning banking system for decades.

They don't inherit money and wonder what to do with it. They inherit a system they've been operating since childhood.

This continuity is what separates families that preserve wealth from families that lose it.

## Beyond the Money

The deepest benefit isn't financial. It's psychological.

Children who grow up in a family banking environment learn **they don't need external institutions to meet their financial needs**. They learn their family can be self-sufficient.

This creates confidence that transcends money. It creates what psychologists call an **internal locus of control** â€” the belief that you can influence outcomes through your own actions.

Children from families that depend on banks, mortgage companies, and investment firms learn the opposite. They learn to seek external validation for financial decisions. They learn dependence.

**This difference in mindset affects every area of life**, not just finances.

The child who learns to control capital learns to control outcomes. The child who learns to depend on institutions learns to depend on others.

One mindset builds wealth. The other consumes it.

## The Teacher's Responsibility

If you want your children to preserve and grow family wealth, you must become their primary financial educator.

This doesn't mean lecturing them about compound interest. It means including them in real financial decisions that demonstrate how money actually works.

Show them the policy statements. Explain the loan mechanics. Let them observe the decision-making process.

**When they're young, focus on observation.** Let them watch how the system operates.

**As they mature, increase participation.** Give them responsibilities within the system.

**Eventually, transfer control.** Move from teacher to advisor as they demonstrate understanding.

The goal is producing children who think like bankers, not customers. Who understand systems, not just products. Who can create wealth, not just inherit it.

## Starting Today

You don't need perfect knowledge to begin. You need sufficient understanding and willingness to learn alongside your children.

Start with policies on yourself — you are the first generation practicing the banking function. As you reach maximum insurability and your cash flow allows, fund policies on the second generation. Once your children have children, then you fund policies on the third generation. This is Nash's Even Distribution of Age Classes in practice — building a forest, not planting a single tree.

**Most importantly, change your own relationship with money** so your children observe better habits.

Stop borrowing from institutions when you could borrow from yourself. Stop obsessing over investment returns when you could focus on capital control. Stop teaching your children to be customers when you could teach them to be bankers.

The statistics on generational wealth loss are brutal but not inevitable. Families that teach the banking function break the cycle.

**Your children's financial future depends more on what they observe than what they inherit.** Give them something worth observing.

The family banking system isn't just about money. It's about **knowledge, control, and independence that compound across generations**.

That's an inheritance worthy of Proverbs 13:22. And it's completely within your power to create.
