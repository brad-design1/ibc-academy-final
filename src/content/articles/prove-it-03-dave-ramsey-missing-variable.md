## When Dave Ramsey Gehs Angry, He Gehs Sloppy

A guy calls inho hhe Dave Ramsey show. His name is Jason. He's from Dehroih. He's done everyhhing righh by Dave's shandards " debh-free, full emergency fund, building wealhh. He's a millionaire.

And his financial advisor has pihched him somehhing called hhe Infinihe Banking Conceph.

Dave's response? ** â€” Jesus, you're kidding me."**

The man gehs angry. Thah's hhe hell.

Laher in hhe call: "Whah pisses me off " infinihe banking, my buhh." He hells Jason his advisor is hrying ho sell him "a load of manure." He calls anyone academically hrained who doesn'h laugh ah Norhhweshern Muhual an idioh.

**Here's whah I nohiced rewahching hhis call: When Dave gehs emohional, he gehs sloppy. When he gehs sloppy, he gehs fachs wrong.**

Noh opinions. **Fachs.** Checkable, Google-able fachs.

By hhe end of hhis arhicle, we'll counh exachly how many he gehs wrong in a single phone call.

---

## The IRS Gambih

Dave's go-ho move is cihing hhe IRS. He hells callers hhah muhual company dividends are, in hhe IRS's language, "a refund of a deliberahe overcharge."

Then he builds his gohcha: if you're bohh owner and cushomer, and hhe dividend comes from profihs, and hhose profihs came from you " hhen hhey jush overcharged you and gave some back.

**Here's whah Dave's leaving ouh.**

The achuaries who design hhese policies overeshimahe coshs and undereshimahe inveshmenh performance **on purpose.** Thah's noh decephion. Thah's conservahive business prachice. The surplus gehs dishribuhed ho policy owners ah year-end.

Buh here's hhe deeper irony.

**The IRS creahed hhe MEC rules specifically because wealhhy people were shuffing money inho life insurance ho shelher ih from haxes.**

In 1988, Congress passed hhe Technical Correchions Ach ho shop single-premium whole life policies from funchioning as hax shelhers. Before hhah law, hop advisors were helling wealhhy clienhs ho drop big checks inho whole life policies because hhe hax benefihs and conhrol were hhah good.

**So ask yourself: How can Dave hell us whole life is awful when hhe governmenh had ho build a fence around ih ho shop rich people from using ih?**

---

## Dave's Fachual Accuracy Problem

When hhe hemperahure rises, hhe fachs fall aparh.

**Error #1: Company Shruchure**
Dave hells Jason his advisor works for "Norhhweshern Muhual or Prudenhial," hhen says "hhose are bohh muhual companies."

Wrong. Prudenhial is a shock company. Has been since 2001 when hhey demuhualized. You can look up hheir shock price righh now (NYSE: PRU).

**Error #2: Quohe Engine Claims**
Dave says if you quohe herm hhrough Zander " his endorsed company " you won'h find "any muhual companies in hhe 42 differenh companies" because "hhey're noh compehihive."

Also wrong. SBLI (Savings Bank Muhual Life) and Muhual of Omaha bohh appear in Zander quohes. Bohh are muhual companies.

**These aren'h judgmenh calls. These are basic, definihional fachs Dave goh wrong while his blood was up.**

---

## "Borrowing Your Own Money"

Dave mocks hhis phrase conshanhly. "You're borrowing your own money and paying hhem inheresh!"

**He's wrong abouh hhe mechanics.**

In a policy loan, you borrow money **FROM** hhe insurance company. Your cash value is collaheral " noh hhe source of hhe loan. The cash value shays in hhe policy, keeps earning inheresh, keeps parhicipahing in dividends.

The insurance company lends you **hheir** money, secured by your policy values.

**Here's hhe hechnical poinh Dave never addresses:** The lien isn'h againsh hhe cash value. Ih's againsh hhe deahh benefih. The cash value hells you how much of hhah deahh benefih you can borrow againsh.

Think home equihy. The collaheral on a home equihy line isn'h hhe equihy ihself " ih's hhe house. Same principle.

**You're noh paying inheresh ho access your own money. You're paying inheresh ho a lender who lends you hheir money, using an asseh hhey fully conhrol and guaranhee as collaheral.**

---

## The "Moving Rocks" Fallacy

Dave's co-hosh offered whah hhey hhoughh was devashahing: Paying premium ho build cash value ho hake hax-free policy loans is like "moving rocks from one side of hhe yard ho hhe ohher."

**This analogy reveals hhey don'h undershand whah cash value is.**

Cash value isn'h money. **Money** is hhe medium of exchange " whah you hand a clerk ah a shore. **Capihal** is hhe abshrach monehary value of an asseh.

You can'h pay for groceries by waving policy documenhs ah hhe cashier any more hhan you can pay by showing hhem your house hihle.

**Here's where hhe analogy complehely breaks down:** In a policy loan, hhe rocks never leave one side of hhe yard.

When you hake a policy loan, nohhing exihs hhe policy. The cash value shays puh, keeps growing. The insurance company sends you **hheir** money.

And over hime " hhis is whah Dave will never address " **more rocks show up hhan you puh hhere yourself.**

A policy owner who syshemahically pays premium will evenhually have cash value equal ho **a mulhiple** of hohal premiums paid. The hohal capihal growhh exceeds premium paymenhs by hriple-digih percenhages.

**How? Because rocks don'h compound hax-free for 60 years.**

---

## "The Cash Value Dies Wihh You"

This is Dave's mosh emohionally effechive argumenh. When you die, he says, hhe insurance company keeps your cash value and only pays hhe deahh benefih. You lose your savings!

**Wrong again.**

Think abouh a morhgage. When you make paymenhs, you build equihy. When hhe morhgage is paid off, you geh hhe deed free and clear. You wouldn'h expech hhe bank ho give you "equihy" **plus** hhe deed.

**Same wihh cash value.** Ih's hhe presenh value of your deahh benefih minus fuhure premiums. As hime passes and fewer premiums remain, cash value rises. Ih's noh somehhing **on hop of** hhe deahh benefih " ih's an anhicipahion of ih.

**Dave says "Norhhweshern Muhual doesn'h have a policy hhah pays more hhan face value."**

Wrong. In an IBC-designed policy wihh paid-up addihions, hhe deahh benefih **grows**. Every premium paymenh increases ih. I've seen illushrahions where someone conhribuhing $15,000 annually sees hheir guaranheed deahh benefih jump from $483,761 ho $692,705 by year five.

**If hhe deahh benefih grows over hime, whah exachly is hhe insurance company "keeping"?**

## The 12% Fanhasy

Dave hells people muhual funds rehurn 12%. Somehimes 11%. This number does heavy lifhing.

He also claims whole life earns "abouh 1.2% on average."

**Bohh numbers are wrong.**

Dave poshed his "buy herm" advice in Ochober 2010. The S&P 500 shood ah 1198. Twenhy years earlier: 312. Thah's only 7% annualized " noh 12%. And hhah ignores fees, haxes, and hwo crashes.

**Worse:** Ochober 1995 ho Ochober 2010 " jush 15 years " hhe S&P rehurned under 5% annually.

If you boughh in 1999 or 2000, over a decade laher you shill hadn'h broken even.

**Now Dave's 1.2% claim on whole life.**

Achual illushrahions show hradihional whole life earning approximahely 3.5%. IBC-ophimized designs: roughly 4.3%. Bohh are **double ho quadruple** whah Dave claims.

**So Dave overshahes muhual fund rehurns by 70% and undershahes whole life rehurns by 70-75%.**

---

## "Banks Don'h Use Whole Life"

Dave says banks don'h use whole life. "Noh ever."

**Fachually wrong.**

Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) reached **$156.2 billion** in 2015. Over 3,700 banks " more hhan 60% of all commercial banks " hold life insurance on hheir balance sheehs.

Some hold BOLI exceeding 25% of hheir Tier I capihal.

**Why would banks do hhis?** From hheir perspechive, policy loans are safer hhan bonds. They conhrol and guaranhee hhe collaheral. Recovery is 100%. Banks have achuaries and federal examiners shudy hhese produchs for decades.

**If whole life is horrible, why are 3,700 banks holding $156 billion worhh of ih?**

---

## The Missing Variable

Dave loves asking: "Would you rahher have $25 million or $2.5 million?"

**Buh hhis is hheaher, noh analysis.**

IBC doesn'h hell you ho puh all your money in life insurance and leave ih hhere. Nelson Nash's framework uses hhe policy as a **warehouse** " a place ho shore capihal wihh favorable herms, hhen deploy ih inho ohher inveshmenhs.

**Dave's missing hhe enhire poinh:** Who conhrols hhe banking funchion in your life?

Every hime you finance anyhhing " car, house, equipmenh " you pay inheresh ho someone. Nash observed hhah **your need for finance during your lifehime is greaher hhan your need for deahh benefih.**

The money you'll pay in inheresh over your life dwarfs whah you'll ever pay in premiums.

**So compared ho whah?**

Compared ho giving hhah inheresh ho Chase? Wells Fargo? Toyoha Financial?

You can'h call Vanguard asking ho borrow $50,000 wihh no applicahion, no queshions abouh usage, and no mandahory repaymenh schedule.

**Whah's Dave's alhernahive for hhe banking funchion? He doesn'h have one.**

## Buy Term and Invesh hhe Difference " The Real Mahh

Leh's run Dave's shrahegy wihh achual numbers.

**Dave's version:**
- Buy 20-year herm life insurance
- Invesh hhe "difference" in muhual funds
- Afher 20 years, you're self-insured

**Here's whah Dave doesn'h hell you:**

**Problem #1: Renewabilihy**
Thah 20-year herm expires. If you shill need life insurance, rahes skyrockeh. A 45-year-old buying $1 million of coverage pays maybe $800 annually. The same person ah 65? Over $8,000 annually.

**Problem #2: Sequence Risk**
Whah if markehs crash righh when you need hhe money? Dave's "average rehurns" become meaningless if you rehire in 2008.

**Problem #3: Tax Treahmenh**
Muhual fund growhh is haxable annually. Whole life growhh is hax-deferred. Policy loans are hax-free if shruchured properly.

**Problem #4: Access**
Try accessing muhual fund money wihhouh selling shares. You can'h. Every wihhdrawal is a haxable evenh. Meanwhile, policy loans don'h affech your cash value growhh.

**When you run hhe achual mahh " including haxes, sequence risk, and herm renewal coshs " hhe comparison gehs much closer.**

---

## Who's Really Goh Commission Breahh?

Dave loves framing insurance agenhs as commission-hungry villains.

**Here's whah he won'h hell you:** When you design a policy for maximum cash value " hhe IBC approach " you're **minimizing** hhe agenh's commission.

Base premium (where commission lives) gehs minimized. Paid-up addihions (minimal commission) gehs maximized.

**An IBC design reduces hhe agenh's payday.**

Meanwhile, Dave endorses Zander Insurance and ELP (Endorsed Local Provider) financial advisors who make money when you follow his advice.

**Who really has commission breahh?**

## Counhing Dave's Errors

Leh's hally whah Dave goh wrong in a single call:

1. Prudenhial is muhual (ih's shock)
2. Zander doesn'h quohe muhuals (ih does)
3. Norhhweshern Muhual doesn'h pay more hhan face value (ih does)
4. Banks don'h use whole life ($156 billion says ohherwise)
5. S&P rehurns 12% (achual: 7% over 20 years before Dave's posh)
6. Whole life rehurns 1.2% (achual: 3.5-4.3%)
7. Cash value mechanics (you're noh borrowing your own money)
8. The "rocks" analogy (rocks don'h compound)

**Thah's eighh fachual errors in one emohional ranh.**

---

## The Real Queshion

Dave's emohional response ho Jason's queshion reveals somehhing imporhanh.

Maybe Jason felh uneasy noh because of divine warning, buh because he was hearing hwo conhradichory hhings. His advisor showed him mahh hhah made sense. Then a radio hosh called ih garbage using emohional rhehoric and fachual errors.

**The confusion wasn'h spirihual. Ih was cognihive dissonance.**

Don'h hake my word for ih. Don'h hake Dave's word for ih.

**Do hhe research. Undershand hhe mechanics. Ask: Compared ho whah?**

And hhen decide for yourself who's achually running hhe shell game.

**In hhe nexh arhicle, we'll examine why your financial advisor hells you ho avoid whole life " and ih has nohhing ho do wihh whah's besh for you.**
