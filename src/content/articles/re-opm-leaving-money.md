# OPM: The Money You're Leaving on the Table

Go to any real estate investing meetup. Hang around for ten minutes. You'll hear it.

"I use OPM."

It's become a badge of sophistication. A signal that you understand how the game is really played. Other People's Money. Why use your own capital when you can use theirs?

The phrase gets dropped with confidence, usually followed by a knowing nod. *This person gets it. This person has figured out leverage.*

Here's the thing nobody talks about at those meetups: OPM isn't free.

Every dollar of "other people's money" comes with a price tag. A real one. Paid in real dollars. Over real years. And when you add it all up across a career of 10, 15, or 20 deals—the total is staggering.

That money doesn't disappear into thin air. It goes somewhere. It builds wealth for someone. Just not for you.

## The Real Cost of "Free" Money

Let's run some numbers. Not theoretical numbers. Numbers from a real estate investing career.

You find a property for $200,000. You put down 25% and finance the rest. A $150,000 mortgage at 7.5% over 30 years.

That's a monthly payment of $1,049. Over the life of the loan, you'll pay back $377,640.

The interest alone? **$227,640.**

You borrowed $150,000. You paid back $227,640 in interest—plus the original principal. That's a 152% markup on the borrowed amount.

But wait, you say. I'm not holding for 30 years. I'm doing the BRRRR thing. Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat. I'll be out in 5 years, maybe 10.

Fair enough. Let's look at that.

Same loan. Held for 7 years—a typical investment timeline before refinancing or selling. You'll pay approximately **$72,000 in interest** on that single property.

Still feel like free money?

## The Career Picture

Here's where it gets uncomfortable.

A moderately active real estate investor might do 15 deals over a 20-year career. Not a guru with 500 doors. Just someone who's serious, consistent, and building wealth through real estate.

Let's assume an average financed amount of $150,000 per property, held for an average of 7 years before selling or refinancing. At 7.5% interest:

- Interest per deal: ~$72,000
- Number of deals: 15
- **Total career interest paid: $1,080,000**

That's over a million dollars in interest. Paid to banks. Over a 20-year career.

And that's a conservative estimate. It doesn't include:
- Bridge loans at 10-12% for acquisitions
- Hard money at 12-15% for renovations
- Lines of credit carrying variable rates
- Refinancing costs every time you restructure

Factor those in, and the real number is closer to $1.3 to $1.5 million.

## Where Does It Go?

Here's the question nobody asks at those meetups: *Where does all that interest go?*

It doesn't evaporate. It doesn't fund public goods. It doesn't return to the economy in some diffuse, beneficial way.

It goes to the bank's balance sheet.

Every dollar you pay in interest is a dollar that builds equity for the bank's shareholders. It's capital—your capital—working to make someone else wealthy.

Nelson Nash put it bluntly: banking is the most important business in the world. Every business, every family, every investor needs financing at some point. Whoever controls the banking function profits from it.

When you use OPM, you're not bypassing the banking system. You're feeding it. The bank isn't lending you money out of goodness. They're in the business of turning your productivity into their profit.

And they're very, very good at it.

## The "Sophisticated" Investor

Here's what bothers me about the OPM narrative.

Real estate investors spend enormous energy optimizing everything else. They drive for dollars. They negotiate purchase prices down to the penny. They shop contractors, squeeze vendors, analyze cap rates to the decimal point.

Then they hand a million dollars in interest to a bank without a second thought.

Because that's "just how it works." Because "leverage is sophisticated." Because "OPM is how the wealthy build wealth."

But is it?

Grant Cardone nearly went bankrupt in 2009. Not because his properties were bad. Not because his tenants stopped paying. Because his banks called his loans due. They changed direction during the economic reversal, and suddenly the "sophisticated leverage" that built his empire became the noose around his neck.

He was, as Ryan Griggs put it, "at the mercy of the banks."

That's the part of OPM nobody mentions at the meetup. The control isn't yours. The terms aren't yours. The timing isn't yours. You're a customer of someone else's banking system, subject to their rules, their underwriting, their appetite for risk.

When the economy turns—exactly when you need access to capital most—the banks get nervous. They call notes. They freeze lines. They decline renewals. The capital disappears precisely when it matters most.

Sophisticated?

## The Wrong Question

Nelson Nash taught something that reframes this entire conversation.

When someone asks, "What's the interest rate?"—they're asking the wrong question.

The right question is: ** â€” Compared to what?"**

Compared to what? That's the question that unlocks everything.

When you pay 7% on a bank mortgage, compared to what? Compared to paying cash and giving up the returns that cash could have generated? Compared to a hard money loan at 12%? Compared to not doing the deal at all?

Here's what most investors never consider: compared to financing through a system where the interest payments return to *you*.

That's the comparison that changes the math entirely.

## A Different Kind of OPM

What if "other people's money" didn't have to mean the bank's money?

In a policy loan from a mutual life insurance company, you borrow from the insurer's general account. The loan is collateralized by your death benefit—which the company guarantees. Your cash value continues growing as if you never borrowed a dime.

The money you borrow is technically other people's money. The insurance company's money. But here's the difference:

- No credit check
- No income verification
- No questions about what you're using it for
- No mandatory repayment schedule
- No possibility of the loan being called due

You take the loan. You buy the property. You renovate it. You rent it out. You refinance into permanent financing or sell at a profit.

Meanwhile, your cash value kept growing. The policy doesn't know or care that you have a loan outstanding. It just keeps compounding.

And when you pay back the loan—on your schedule, at your pace—the interest you pay goes to a mutual company where you're an owner. Not to a bank where you're just another customer.

## Running the Numbers Again

Let's revisit that 15-deal career with a different structure.

Same deals. Same $150,000 average financed amount. But now you're using policy loans for acquisition capital and bridge financing—the pieces that typically carry the highest interest rates.

Conservative assumptions:
- You use policy loans for 40% of your financing needs (acquisition, bridge, rehab capital)
- Policy loan rate: 5-6%
- Your cash value continues growing at 3-4% while loans are outstanding
- When you pay back the loans, the interest returns to a system where you're an owner

The interest on bank financing drops because you're using less of it. The interest on policy loans is partially offset by continued cash value growth. And the interest you do pay on policy loans stays within your orbit.

Net interest cost over 20 years: approximately $600,000-$700,000.

That's $400,000-$500,000 **less** paid to outside institutions over your career.

But that's not even the real win.

The real win is that your cash value—which kept growing the entire time—now represents a substantial pool of accessible capital. Not locked in a retirement account. Not tied up in equity you can't touch. Liquid, accessible, yours.

At policy loan rates. Without permission. On your timeline.

## The Banking Function

Nash had a phrase for this: "the banking function."

Banking isn't a building. It's not a website. It's not a person in a suit behind a desk. Banking is a *process*—the origination and repayment of loans, and who profits from that cycle.

That process is happening in your life right now. Every time you borrow, every time you pay interest, every time you give up returns by paying cash—the banking function is operating.

The only question is: who's running it?

When you use conventional OPM, the bank runs the banking function in your life. They profit from your productivity. They build capital from your capital.

When you structure things differently—when you capitalize a system you control—you can capture some of that banking function for yourself. Not all of it. Real estate investing requires leverage, and you'll probably always use some conventional financing. But the portion you do control makes an enormous difference over time.

## What Are You Really Optimizing?

Here's the shift in thinking.

Most real estate investors optimize for one thing: cash-on-cash return. They want to know how much they're making relative to the cash they put in.

That's not wrong. It's just incomplete.

The more interesting question is: what's happening to the *total* capital flowing through your life? Not just the return on the amount you invested—but the interest on the amount you borrowed. Not just what you made—but what you paid.

When you look at the full picture, a new strategy emerges.

You stop asking, "How do I maximize leverage?" and start asking, "How do I minimize the capital I'm giving away?"

You stop treating OPM as free and start treating it as what it is: an expense, like any other, that should be minimized and controlled where possible.

You stop feeding someone else's banking system and start building your own.

## The Money on the Table

A million dollars in interest over a career. That's what's on the table.

Not all of it is recoverable. Some conventional financing is unavoidable. But a significant portion—hundreds of thousands of dollars—doesn't have to flow out the door.

That's money that could stay in your system. Growing. Compounding. Available for the next deal.

That's what OPM really costs. And that's what you're really leaving on the table when you use someone else's banking system without thinking about whether there's an alternative.

The meetup gurus won't tell you this. The banks certainly won't tell you this. They'd prefer you keep thinking of leverage as sophisticated and OPM as free.

But now you know. OPM isn't free. It's expensive. And there might be another way.

The question Nash would ask is simple: *Compared to what?*

What if you captured some of that banking function for yourself?
