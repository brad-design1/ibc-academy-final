# What is Infinite Banking? The Guide Nobody Wants You to Read

*Why Nelson Nash's concept threatens every bank, financial planner, and investment guru—and why that's exactly why you need to understand it*

---

I've been teaching the Infinite Banking Concept for five years. 

Know what I've learned?

Most people think they want financial advice. What they really want is permission to keep doing what they're already doing—just with better results.

They want the stock market to go up forever. They want real estate to appreciate endlessly. They want their 401(k) to magically generate income without risk.

But nobody wants to hear this truth: You're already your own banker. You're just terrible at it.

Right now, as you read this, you're financing your entire life. Every purchase. Every decision. Every dollar.

Either you're paying interest to someone else's bank.

Or you're giving up interest you could have earned.

There is no third option.

The question isn't whether banking happens in your life. It does. Every single day.

The question is: Are you going to be the bank? Or are you going to pay the bank?

---

## Stop Calling It an Investment (Because It's Not)

Here's where everyone gets confused.

Infinite Banking isn't an investment strategy. It's not a retirement plan. It's not even about life insurance, really.

It's about banking.

Nelson Nash—the guy who figured this out—put it simply:

*"Banking is the most important business in the world! Without it, all business comes to a screeching halt."*

Think about it.

You need money to buy a house. That's banking.
You need money to buy a car. Banking.
You want to start a business. Banking.
You want to send your kid to college. Banking.

Every financial goal requires the movement of money from one place to another. That movement? That's the banking function.

And right now, you're paying someone else to perform that function with your own money.

### The Investment Trap

Financial planners love to talk about "diversification" and "asset allocation." They'll show you pie charts with 60% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% alternatives.

Meanwhile, you're hemorrhaging wealth through the financing function.

You're optimizing the 5% you manage to save while ignoring the 35% you lose to interest payments.

It's like obsessing over the temperature in your house while leaving the front door wide open.

### What Nash Actually Discovered

In November 1980, Nelson Nash was 49 years old. Interest rates hit 23%. He owed half a million dollars.

Not at prime rate—he didn't qualify for prime. Twenty-three percent.

That meant $115,000 a year bleeding out in interest payments. In today's money, over $350,000 annually.

Nash had followed all the "expert" advice. Buy real estate. Use leverage. Debt is good if you can deduct it.

Now he was trapped.

The revelation came at 3 a.m., during one of those long nights when financial pressure keeps you awake:

*You are standing in the midst of everything it takes to get out—but you don't see it because you look at things like everyone else.*

The solution wasn't new investments or better returns. It was the whole life insurance policies sitting in his office drawer—policies he'd owned for twenty years without understanding their real power.

Not the death benefit. Not the cash value growth.

The banking characteristics.

## How Banking Really Works (The Lesson They Don't Teach)

Every bank in the world operates on one simple principle.

They gather money from depositors at one rate. They lend that same money to borrowers at a higher rate. The difference is their profit.

Your savings account pays 0.5%. Your car loan costs 6%. The credit card charges 18%.

Same money. Different rates. That spread is how banks stay in business.

### The Beautiful Trap

Banks have convinced you that this arrangement is normal. Natural. Necessary.

You supply them with capital through your deposits. They lend you back your own capital at marked-up rates. And you thank them for the privilege.

It's like stocking someone else's grocery store, then buying groceries back at retail prices.

Would you do that? Of course not.

But that's exactly what happens every time you deposit money in a bank and then borrow money from a bank.

### Your Family Banking System

Here's what Nash figured out:

Whole life insurance—when designed correctly—contains all the characteristics necessary for private banking.

- Guaranteed growth (your bank can't lose money)
- Immediate liquidity (access when you need it)
- Use and growth simultaneously (money works in two places at once)
- No credit applications (it's your money to access)
- Tax advantages (growth and loans treated favorably)

When you own a policy with a mutual company, you're not just a customer. You're an owner.

Every dollar of profit the company makes gets returned to policyholders as dividends. You're sharing in the profits of a financial institution.

But here's the key: The policy has to be designed for banking, not insurance.

Maximum cash value, not maximum death benefit.

### How Policy Loans Actually Work

This is where most people get confused.

When you take a "policy loan," you're not withdrawing your own money. You're borrowing money FROM the insurance company using your cash value as collateral.

Your cash value stays in the policy, earning interest and dividends. The insurance company lends you their money at favorable rates because they have 100% guaranteed collateral.

The money is in two places at once. Growing in your policy AND financing your life.

That's the secret banks don't want you to understand.

## The Grocery Store That Changes Everything

Nash used this analogy because if you understand it, everything else becomes obvious.

Imagine you need groceries. You have two choices:

Choice 1: Drive to the store, buy what you need, go home.

Choice 2: Own the store, stock it with what you need, shop from your own shelves.

In the first scenario, you get groceries. In the second, you get groceries AND the profit margin.

### The Banking Parallel

You need the banking function. Loans for cars, houses, equipment. Storage for savings. The movement of money.

Right now, you're driving to someone else's bank for these services.

What if you owned the bank?

### The Capitalization Phase

Every grocery store needs inventory before it can serve customers. You can't open the doors with empty shelves.

Same with banking. Your premiums aren't expenses—they're capitalization. Every dollar you put into your policy is inventory on the shelf.

The early years feel slow because you're stocking shelves. Building the warehouse that makes everything else possible.

### The Velocity Effect

Once your store is stocked, something interesting happens.

You become both the supplier AND the customer.

You stock the shelves. You shop from those shelves.

But here's where most people screw up the analogy: They think owning the store means giving themselves discounts.

Nash taught the opposite.

Charge yourself market rates—or higher. Why? Because you're a captive customer. Your family will shop there regardless. Meanwhile, you need to stay competitive for everyone else.

In IBC terms: When you borrow from your policy, pay yourself back at rates equal to or higher than banks would charge.

This keeps the interest within your family while maintaining the discipline that makes banking work.

### The Pea Thief Problem

Nash's most important warning: Imagine your grocery store is profitable, but your spouse starts taking groceries out the back door without paying.

A single stolen can doesn't just cost you 60 cents. It requires twenty legitimate sales to break even because you lose the velocity—the turnover that creates wealth.

In banking: Don't steal the peas.

Don't take loans without repayment plans. Don't skip premiums. Don't treat your policy like a piggy bank.

The moment you break the banking discipline, you kill the system.

## The Airplane Problem (Why 95% Stay Stuck)

Picture a commercial airliner at 35,000 feet.

The passengers look out the window and see the ground moving backwards. Houses, roads, cities—all flowing from front to back.

One passenger says to another: "Wow, the earth is really moving fast in the wrong direction."

Sounds ridiculous, right?

But that's exactly how most people think about money.

They see wealth flowing away from them—car payments, credit cards, mortgages—and think the solution is to earn higher returns on their savings.

They're optimizing the wrong variable.

### The 34.5 Cent Reality

Nash analyzed a typical American family and discovered something shocking:

34.5 cents of every dollar was going to interest payments.

Not principal. Not value received. Pure interest, paid to other people's banking systems.

Meanwhile, these same people spend their coffee breaks arguing about whether their 401(k) earned 8% or 10% last year.

Think about it.

You're hemorrhaging 34.5% through the financing function while obsessing over getting an extra 2% on the tiny fraction you manage to save.

### The Fundamental Question

While everyone else asks "What's the rate of return?" Nash asked a different question:

"How much of the banking function in your life do you control?"

If you finance everything through third parties, you control 0%.
If you're your own banker, you control 100%.

Most people never even consider this dimension of their financial lives.

### Breaking Free

The airplane isn't moving backwards. You are.

The wealth isn't flowing away from you because the earth is moving. It's flowing away because you're sitting in someone else's airplane, paying them to take you where you want to go.

What if you learned to fly your own plane?

---

## Who This Is For (And Who Should Run Away)

Infinite Banking isn't for everyone.

Nash was explicit about this. He didn't want people buying life insurance because some guy on YouTube made it sound easy.

### You Might Be Ready If...

**You understand the difference between banking and investing**
This isn't about beating the stock market. It's about controlling the banking function in your life.

**You can think in decades, not quarters**
Building a banking system takes time. If you need quick results or immediate access to all your money, this isn't for you.

**You're already a disciplined saver**
IBC amplifies existing discipline. It doesn't create discipline you don't have.

**You run a business or have irregular income**
Entrepreneurs understand the value of controlling their own financing. You need flexible access to capital without bank committees and credit applications.

**You want to build multi-generational wealth**
This is about more than your retirement. It's about creating a family banking system that serves children and grandchildren.

### You Should Avoid This If...

**You're chasing maximum returns**
If your only concern is beating market indices, stick with index funds. They're simpler and cheaper.

**You want get-rich-quick results**
IBC is infrastructure, not speculation. It works over time through discipline and patience.

**You can't commit to consistent premiums**
This requires 10+ years of reliable payments. If your income is unstable, fix that first.

**You're philosophically opposed to life insurance**
Since IBC uses whole life as its vehicle, you need to be comfortable owning permanent life insurance.

**You're drowning in consumer debt**
If you can't live below your means consistently, IBC will just become another debt trap.

### The "Why" Matters More Than the Demographics

Nash emphasized that motivation matters more than income level.

The best candidates aren't defined by how much money they make. They're defined by their understanding of the banking function and their commitment to recapturing control.

If you don't understand why you want to become your own banker, you won't have the discipline to make it work.

## Busting the Myths (Why Critics Miss the Point)

The biggest challenge facing IBC isn't economic. It's educational.

Decades of conventional wisdom have created misconceptions that prevent people from understanding how this actually works.

### Myth 1: "You're Borrowing Your Own Money"

**The Claim:** Policy loans mean borrowing your own money and paying yourself interest, which sounds absurd.

**The Reality:** You're borrowing money FROM the insurance company using your cash value as collateral. Your cash value stays in the policy earning interest and dividends.

It's the only credit arrangement where the lender guarantees the collateral. If you don't repay, they deduct the balance from your death benefit.

This unique structure enables favorable terms impossible anywhere else.

### Myth 2: "Life Insurance Is a Terrible Investment"

**The Claim:** Whole life has poor returns compared to stock market investing.

**The Reality:** This comparison misses the point entirely. Whole life isn't an investment—it's banking infrastructure.

Comparing it to stocks is like comparing a bank building to a stock portfolio. They serve completely different functions.

Nash wasn't selling investments. He was teaching people to become their own banker.

### Myth 3: "The Fees Kill You"

**The Claim:** First-year expenses and commissions make whole life uneconomical.

**The Reality:** These are capitalization costs, like building a bank branch before it serves customers. Every business requires upfront investment before generating returns.

Historical perspective: Before 1988, wealthy people were pouring money into single-premium life insurance specifically for the tax advantages. Congress passed MEC rules to stop this because the benefits were too good.

If it's such a bad deal, why did the government build fences around it?

### Myth 4: "Buy Term and Invest the Difference"

**The Claim:** Buy cheap term insurance and invest the premium difference in mutual funds.

**The Reality:** This strategy fails because it separates protection from savings, ignores the banking function, and assumes perfect investment discipline.

Term insurance expires when you need it most. "Investing the difference" requires discipline most people don't have. Mutual funds don't provide liquidity for life's needs.

You still need banking services. Why not own the bank?

### Myth 5: "It Only Benefits the Insurance Company"

**The Claim:** IBC is a scam designed to enrich agents and companies.

**The Reality:** Mutual life insurance companies are owned by their policyholders. When these companies profit, policyholders benefit through dividends.

You're not enriching strangers. You're building equity in a company you own.

### The Real Issue

Most misconceptions stem from trying to understand IBC through conventional financial thinking.

It's like trying to understand email by comparing it to postal mail. You miss the fundamental transformation.

Once you understand that this is about banking, not investing, the misconceptions dissolve.

## How to Get Started (Without Screwing It Up)

Implementation matters more than understanding.

You can grasp the concept perfectly and still destroy your banking system through poor execution.

### Step 1: Education (Not Optional)

Before implementing anything, understand IBC thoroughly:

Read *Becoming Your Own Banker* by Nelson Nash. Multiple times.
Study the grocery store analogy until it becomes obvious.
Understand Austrian economics basics and sound money principles.

If you don't understand the "why" behind what you're doing, you won't have the discipline to make it work.

### Step 2: Honest Financial Assessment

IBC amplifies existing discipline. It doesn't create discipline you don't have.

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Stable income for consistent premium payments
- Living below your means with room for additional "savings"
- Basic financial stability (not drowning in debt)
- Long-term commitment (10+ years minimum)

### Step 3: Find the Right Practitioner

Not every insurance agent understands IBC. Most don't.

You need someone who:
- Has studied Nelson Nash's original teachings
- Designs policies for banking, not death benefit
- Focuses on education over sales tactics
- Has years of IBC implementation experience

Warning signs of poor practitioners:
- Promising unrealistic returns
- Focusing only on illustrations without education
- Treating IBC like just another investment product
- Not discussing the discipline required

### Step 4: Proper Policy Design

Effective IBC policies are designed differently than traditional life insurance:

**Minimize base premium** to avoid MEC status
**Maximize paid-up additions** for immediate cash value
**Choose mutual companies** with strong dividend histories
**Focus on early cash accumulation** over death benefit

The policy must be designed for banking function, not insurance coverage.

### Step 5: Implementation Strategy

Start with what you can consistently afford. Build gradually. Add policies on family members as the system develops.

Practice discipline from day one. Every loan needs a repayment plan. Every premium payment matters.

Use dividends to accelerate the system, not as spending money.

### Step 6: Ongoing Management

Annual reviews of performance and strategy. Loan discipline that maintains system integrity. Continuous education on advanced techniques.

System expansion as income grows and needs develop.

### Common Mistakes That Kill Systems

1. **Inadequate capitalization** - Starting too small to create meaningful banking capacity
2. **Impatience** - Expecting immediate results instead of building infrastructure
3. **Poor loan discipline** - Taking money without repayment plans
4. **Wrong company choice** - Using companies without strong dividend performance
5. **Improper design** - Focusing on death benefit instead of cash accumulation
6. **Lack of education** - Implementing without understanding fundamentals

## A Real Family's Journey

Let me tell you about the Martinez family.

Dad owns a plumbing business. Mom keeps the books. Four kids, ages 8 to 16. Combined income around $180,000.

Like most people, they were doing "everything right" according to conventional wisdom. Maxing out 401(k)s. Funding IRAs. Term life insurance. Emergency fund in savings.

They were following the plan. Getting predictable results.

### The Awakening

Dad's accountant mentioned Nash's book during tax season. Skeptical but curious, Dad read *Becoming Your Own Banker* twice.

Something clicked. Not the mechanics—the philosophy.

He wasn't excited about life insurance returns. He was excited about escaping the banking trap that was bleeding his family dry.

### Building the System

**Year 1**: Dad established his primary policy. $40,000 annual premium capacity. Base premium minimized to avoid MEC. Most premium flowing to paid-up additions for immediate cash value.

**Year 2**: Mom's policy added for secondary banking capacity. $15,000 annually.

**Years 3-4**: Four children's policies established at $2,000 each. Parents retain ownership. Sixty years of compound growth ahead.

### The Banking Begins

**Year 4**: Dad financed a new work truck through his policy instead of the dealer. 5% to himself versus 8% to Ford Credit.

**Year 5**: Family SUV purchased through Mom's policy. Interest stayed in the family instead of flowing to a bank.

**Year 7**: Break-even point. Annual dividends began exceeding annual premiums.

### The Compound Effect

**After 10 Years**:
- Dad's policy: $350,000+ in accessible capital
- Mom's policy: $120,000+ in cash value
- Children's policies: $25,000+ each and growing
- Total family banking system: Over $500,000

**After 20 Years**:
- Combined system: $1.2+ million in available capital
- Annual dividend income: Approaching six figures
- Bank dependence: Virtually eliminated

### What Made It Work

**Discipline**: Never "stole the peas"—every loan had a repayment plan
**Patience**: Understood this was infrastructure, not speculation
**Education**: Continued studying and learning
**Professional guidance**: Worked with someone who understood Nash's method

The Martinez family went from being customers of the banking system to owners of their own.

Not through magic. Through mathematics and discipline.

## What Happens Next

Maybe you're ready to escape the banking trap. Maybe you're still skeptical.

Both are fine.

But if you're going to dismiss the Infinite Banking Concept, at least dismiss what Nash actually taught. Not what some financial planner says he taught.

Read his book. Understand the grocery store analogy. Grasp why banking matters more than investing.

Then—and only then—decide if IBC makes sense for you.

### If You're Ready

Find someone who actually understands Nash's method. Someone trained in proper implementation. Someone who can guide you through the process without the amateur mistakes that kill most attempts.

Start with education, not product. Understand the philosophy before the mechanics.

Design for banking function, not death benefit.

Commit to the discipline that makes it work.

### If You're Not

That's fine too. But you'll understand why 3% of people control 97% of the money.

It's not because they got lucky.

It's because they understood banking.

### A Final Thought

You're going to finance your life. Cars, houses, business equipment, kids' education. That's not optional in a modern economy.

The question Nash forces you to confront is simple: Are you going to finance those things through other people's banks? Or through your own?

Every car payment you make to yourself instead of Ford Credit. Every equipment loan you repay to your own system instead of Wells Fargo. Every dollar of interest that flows back into your policies instead of out to someone else's bank.

That's where wealth comes from. Not magic. Mathematics.

And the beautiful thing? Once you see it, you can't unsee it.

The choice is yours: Keep paying banks to use your own money. Or become the bank.

Just remember—either way, you're financing everything you buy.

The only question is who profits.
