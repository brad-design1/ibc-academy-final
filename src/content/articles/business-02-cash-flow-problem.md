## It Wasn't Supposed to Be This Hard

Your business made $320,000 last year. After expenses and your salary, there was real profit. You're not strugglingâ€”quite the opposite. Compared to most people, you're doing exceptionally well.

So why does it feel like you're always scrambling for capital?

Last month, a competitor went up for sale. Good client list, solid reputation, asking $150,000. The kind of acquisition that could grow your business 40% overnight. But when you looked at your accounts, the money wasn't there. Not liquid money, anyway.

Sure, you had profit. You had receivables. You had equipment value on the books. But **cash on hand**? The kind you could wire to an escrow account on Tuesday? 

That was tied up in inventory. In the 60-day payment cycles from your big clients. In the equipment loan you've been faithfully paying down. In the quarterly tax payments. In the working capital that keeps the operation running.

By the time you could have arranged financing, the deal was gone. Someone else swooped in with cash and closed in two weeks.

This isn't a story about being unsuccessful. **This is a story about successful people who can't move fast when it matters.**

## The Feast or Famine Cycle

Let me paint another picture that might sound familiar.

January through March: Slow season. Revenue dips. You lean on the line of credit to maintain cash flow. Pay the essential bills. Hope things pick up.

April through October: Busy season. Revenue spikes. You pay down the credit line, catch up on deferred expenses, finally have some breathing room.

November and December: Holiday slowdown. Revenue drops again. Back to the credit line.

**Rinse and repeat for twenty years.**

This is what most business owners call "normal." Seasonal fluctuations. The rhythm of business. Accounts receivable that ebb and flow. Working capital that's always... working.

But here's what nobody points out:

**You're using someone else's banking system to smooth your cash flow. And they're charging you handsomely for the privilege.**

That line of credit isn't free. Those 60-day payment terms from clients aren't free. The gap between when you pay expenses and when revenue hits your accountâ€”that gap gets filled by borrowed money. And borrowed money has a cost.

## The Math Nobody Shows You

Let's talk numbers. Real ones.

A successful business ownerâ€”let's call her Sarahâ€”runs a marketing consultancy. Good margins. Steady clients. Annual revenue around $580,000.

Sarah's cash flow pattern looks like this:

- **Average accounts receivable:** $65,000 (45-day payment terms)
- **Monthly operating expenses:** $32,000 
- **Line of credit limit:** $75,000
- **Average balance on line of credit:** $48,000
- **Interest rate:** 8.5%

Sarah pays roughly **$4,000 a year** in interest just to cover the gap between her expenses and her collections. That's money leaving her business permanentlyâ€”not building anything, not buying anything, just covering the timing mismatch between cash in and cash out.

Over a 20-year career? **$80,000** in interest payments. Just to manage normal cash flow.

But here's the real costâ€”the one that doesn't show up on her P&L:

**Opportunity cost.**

Last year, Sarah could have picked up three distressed client contracts at a steep discountâ€”$45,000 in annual recurring revenue for a $25,000 upfront investment. But her available cash was tied up in operations. She couldn't move fast enough.

That $45,000 in annual revenue, compounded over even five years, represents hundreds of thousands in lost opportunity. Because Sarah didn't have **immediately accessible capital**.

## The Working Capital Trap

This is what I call the Working Capital Trap, and virtually every business owner falls into it:

**The more successful your business becomes, the more working capital it requires. The more working capital it requires, the less liquid capital you have. The less liquid capital you have, the more dependent you become on outside lenders. The more dependent you become on outside lenders, the more interest you pay. The more interest you pay, the less capital stays in your system.**

It's a cycle. A subtle one. Because the business is growing, you don't notice the wealth leak. But it's there, draining capital that could be compounding for you.

And the bigger the business gets, the bigger the drain becomes.

## When Opportunity Moves at Internet Speed

Here's a story from a client I'll call Marcus.

Marcus owns a successful plumbing company. Twenty-two employees, commercial and residential, gross revenue around $3.2 million. By any measure, he's built something impressive.

In March 2023, Marcus got a call. A competitorâ€”similar size operationâ€”wanted to retire. Solid customer base, good employees, profitable contracts. But the owner wanted to move fast. Family health issues. He was willing to sell for **$1.8 million**, roughly 60% of what the business was actually worth.

Catch? He wanted to close in 45 days. Cash only.

Marcus scrambled. Called his banker. Explained the opportunity. The bank was interestedâ€”after they completed their due diligence. After appraisals. After committee reviews. After, after, after.

Timeline? Four to six months. **Minimum**.

The seller couldn't wait. The deal went to a private equity group that showed up with cash and closed in three weeks.

Marcus watched someone else buy what should have been his acquisition. **Because he didn't control his own capital.**

His business generated plenty of wealth. But when he needed wealth that moved at the speed of opportunity, he had to ask permission. And permission takes time.

## The Real Problem Isn't Revenue

The real problem isn't that your business doesn't generate enough money. The problem is that the money it generates **never sits still long enough to be useful**.

It comes in, pays expenses, covers payroll, services debt, handles taxes, and what's left over gets reinvested or saved for the next cash flow gap.

You're not poor. You're **illiquid**.

And illiquidity is expensive in ways that don't show up on your profit and loss statement:

- **Interest paid to banks** for working capital financing
- **Opportunities missed** because you couldn't move fast enough  
- **Growth delayed** because expansion requires borrowing and approval
- **Stress compounded** because you're always managing timing instead of managing opportunity

## The Question Everyone's Afraid to Ask

Here's the question most business owners are afraid to ask:

**If I'm successful, why do I still feel financially vulnerable?**

You built something. You generate revenue. You provide jobs. You serve clients. You should feel financially secure.

Instead, you feel like you're always one bad month away from stress. One missed payment from a big client away from scrambling. One unexpected expense away from the credit line.

That's not failure. That's not weakness. **That's what happens when you build wealth inside a system designed to keep you dependent on outside capital.**

Your business generates the wealth. Banks capture the financing function. You get the stress of managing bothâ€”without controlling either.

## What You Actually Need

What you actually need isn't more revenue. **You need capital that moves when you move.**

Not capital that requires approval. Not capital that comes with covenants and committees. Not capital that depends on someone else's timeline.

**Capital that's immediately accessible when opportunity appears. Capital that doesn't stop working while you're using it. Capital that builds wealth for your family instead of someone else's shareholders.**

Most business owners think this is impossible. They've been told their whole career that you have to choose:

- **Liquid or growing** (cash in savings versus money invested)
- **Accessible or tax-advantaged** (available now versus deductible later)  
- **Control or returns** (your decisions versus market performance)

What if that's wrong?

What if there was a way to solve the cash flow problem without creating new problems? A way to have capital that's both liquid **and** growing? Available **and** compounding?

**A way to become your own source of working capital?**

## The Real Wealth Leak

The real wealth leak in most businesses isn't overhead. It's not inefficiency. It's not even taxes.

**It's the financing function.**

Every time you pay interest on working capital, you're transferring wealth out of your system. Every time you can't seize an opportunity because capital is tied up, you're losing future wealth. Every time you depend on outside institutions for financing, you're giving someone else control over your timing.

And timing, in business, is everything.

The solution isn't to generate more revenue. Revenue isn't the problem.

**The solution is to control the capital that revenue creates.**

**In the next article, we're going to talk about who's really in the banking businessâ€”and it's not who you think.**

Your bank tells you they're providing a service. What they're actually doing is borrowing your money at one rate and lending it back to you at another. And they're making a fortune doing it.

Time to understand how the banking business really worksâ€”and why you're on the wrong side of it.
