# A Family of Four Implements IBC: A Multi-Generational Case Study

Let me tell you about the Mitchell family.

Not a hypothetical. Not a spreadsheet exercise. A real illustration of what happens when three generations commit to the same process — each planting trees they may never sit under, each harvesting shade from trees planted decades before they were born.

This is a case study with actual numbers. Premiums. Cash values. Death benefits. The kind of specifics that show you exactly how capital compounds when it's structured to pass from one generation to the next without the friction that destroys most family wealth.

## Year One: The Foundation

It's 2010. The Mitchells are a family of four living in suburban Kansas City.

**David Mitchell** is 42. He owns a commercial flooring company — eight employees, about $1.8 million in annual revenue, nets around $220,000 after expenses. He's been running the business for twelve years. Good years and bad years. He knows what it means to need capital when nobody's offering it.

**Sarah Mitchell** is 39. She's a part-time physical therapist, working three days a week at a rehabilitation clinic. Brings in about $65,000. The rest of her time goes to their two kids.

Their combined household income sits around $285,000.

The kids: **Emma** is 12. **Jackson** is 8.

David's parents — **Robert** (68) and **Patricia** (66) — are still healthy, still active, and sitting on about $400,000 in savings they've accumulated over forty years of careful living. Robert was an electrical engineer. Patricia taught high school English. They're comfortable but not wealthy. Their main concern isn't their own retirement — it's what happens to everything they've built when they're gone.

In 2010, Robert reads *Becoming Your Own Banker* by Nelson Nash. A friend from his investment club had mentioned it. Robert reads it twice. Doesn't understand all of it the first time. But something about the forester's logic resonates. Trees. Time. Patience. Generations.

He gives the book to David.

David reads it during a slow week in February when the flooring business always hits a lull. He calls his father the next Sunday.

"I think I get it," David says. "But I need someone to walk me through the numbers."

## The Structure They Built

The family worked with a practitioner who understood what they were trying to accomplish. Not just policies — a system. Here's what they designed.

### The Adults: Funding to Their Insurability Limits

**David's Policy** — Age 42 at issue

- Annual premium: $42,000
- Premium structure: 40% base ($16,800), 60% PUA + term ($25,200)
- Initial death benefit: $1,200,000
- Year 1 cash value: $31,500

David funded his policy at the maximum level his income could support without straining the business. The $42,000 annual premium was significant — about 15% of his take-home income — but he'd been paying $28,000 a year in various loan payments: equipment financing, a line of credit, and a business truck. His plan was to capitalize his policy aggressively for five years, then use policy loans to handle those financing needs internally.

**Sarah's Policy** — Age 39 at issue

- Annual premium: $18,000
- Premium structure: 40% base ($7,200), 60% PUA + term ($10,800)
- Initial death benefit: $520,000
- Year 1 cash value: $13,500

Sarah's policy was smaller — appropriate to her income and insurability — but designed the same way. Together, the couple was contributing $60,000 per year to their family banking system.

### The Grandchildren: Even Distribution of Age Classes

Here's where Nelson Nash's forestry principle comes in.

A timber operation doesn't plant all its trees in the same year. If it did, there'd be nothing to harvest for forty years, then a single bumper crop, then nothing again. Instead, the forester staggers planting across compartments — so every year, some trees are saplings, some are adolescent, some are mature and ready for harvest. Continuous income. No single-point failures.

Nash saw the same logic in family banking. Grandparents fund policies on grandchildren. Parents fund policies on their own children when the time comes. Each generation plants. Each generation harvests. The system perpetuates itself.

Robert and Patricia Mitchell funded policies on their two grandchildren.

**Emma's Policy** — Age 12 at issue (owned by Robert)

- Annual premium: $8,000
- Premium structure: 50% base, 50% PUA + term
- Initial death benefit: $280,000
- Year 1 cash value: $4,800

**Jackson's Policy** — Age 8 at issue (owned by Robert)

- Annual premium: $8,000
- Premium structure: 50% base, 50% PUA + term
- Initial death benefit: $320,000
- Year 1 cash value: $4,800

Robert retained ownership of both grandchildren's policies. He would pay the premiums, control the cash value, and decide when — and whether — to transfer ownership to the next generation.

### Total Family Commitment: Year One

| Policy | Insured | Owner | Annual Premium | Death Benefit | Cash Value |
|--------|---------|-------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Policy A | David (42) | David | $42,000 | $1,200,000 | $31,500 |
| Policy B | Sarah (39) | Sarah | $18,000 | $520,000 | $13,500 |
| Policy C | Emma (12) | Robert | $8,000 | $280,000 | $4,800 |
| Policy D | Jackson (8) | Robert | $8,000 | $320,000 | $4,800 |
| **Total** | | | **$76,000** | **$2,320,000** | **$54,600** |

In year one, the Mitchell family banking system held $54,600 in accessible capital and $2.32 million in death benefit.

The premiums came from two sources: David and Sarah funded their own policies from household income. Robert and Patricia funded the grandchildren's policies from savings — converting a portion of their $400,000 nest egg from bank deposits earning 0.5% into a system that would compound across generations.

## The First Decade: Building the Foundation

The first years felt slow. Premiums went out. Cash value built gradually. No fireworks. The patience Nelson wrote about — this is where it gets tested.

But the Mitchells weren't just accumulating cash value. They were learning to use it.

### Year 3: David's First Policy Loan

David needed a new work truck. The old F-250 had 180,000 miles and was becoming a liability. A replacement would run $52,000.

Old David would have walked into a bank, filled out paperwork, waited two weeks, and signed a note at 6.8% for 60 months. Total interest paid: $9,400. Total cost: $61,400.

New David called his insurance company. His cash value had grown to $98,000. He requested a $52,000 policy loan. Four days later, the money arrived. No credit check. No committee. No explanation required.

He set up an automatic payment from his business account: $980/month — the same payment he would have made to the bank. But instead of paying 6.8% to a third party, he was paying 5% to his insurance company (which went back into the general account supporting his policy) plus an additional 3.8% that went directly into his policy as additional PUA premium.

Same cash flow. Different destination.

The truck got paid off in year 7. His cash value was higher than if he'd never borrowed at all — because he'd been making "interest payments" that were actually premium payments, buying more death benefit and more cash value with every check.

### Year 5: Sarah's Equipment Financing

Sarah's rehabilitation clinic offered her an opportunity to buy in as a partner. The buy-in: $35,000. The upside: her income would jump from $65,000 to approximately $110,000 within two years.

She took a policy loan against her $48,000 in cash value. Paid it back over 24 months. Her income increased exactly as projected. The clinic partnership was funded without a bank, without outside investors, without anyone telling her whether her dream was worth backing.

### Year 8: Emma Needs Braces

$6,200. Not a fortune, but not nothing. The Mitchells paid it from Sarah's policy — a small loan, repaid in nine months. The orthodontist didn't know the money came from a life insurance policy. He just knew he got paid.

### Year 10: The System at Decade One

| Policy | Insured (Age) | Annual Premium | Death Benefit | Cash Value |
|--------|---------------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Policy A | David (52) | $42,000 | $1,480,000 | $412,000 |
| Policy B | Sarah (49) | $18,000 | $680,000 | $168,000 |
| Policy C | Emma (22) | $8,000 | $380,000 | $92,000 |
| Policy D | Jackson (18) | $8,000 | $420,000 | $78,000 |
| **Total** | | **$76,000** | **$2,960,000** | **$750,000** |

Ten years in. $760,000 in total premiums paid. $750,000 in accessible cash value. And $2.96 million in death benefit.

The system wasn't just holding value — it was producing it. David and Sarah had financed a truck, a business buy-in, orthodontics, and two family vacations. Every dollar had passed through their banking system. Every interest payment had stayed inside the family.

And the grandchildren's policies? Emma at 22 had $92,000 in cash value she didn't even know existed. Jackson at 18 had $78,000. Neither had paid a dime. Their grandfather had planted trees they would harvest for the next sixty years.

## Year 15: Robert Graduates

Nelson Nash never said "death." He said "graduation." Not euphemism — theology. The completion of one chapter. The beginning of another.

In 2025, Robert Mitchell graduated at age 83. Peacefully. After a brief illness. Surrounded by family.

His death triggered the first generational transfer in the Mitchell family banking system.

### The Waterfall Begins

Robert's estate included several assets. But the most significant was the two whole life policies he owned on his grandchildren.

**Policy C (Emma)** — Now valued at:
- Cash value: $148,000
- Death benefit: $520,000
- Outstanding loans: $0

**Policy D (Jackson)** — Now valued at:
- Cash value: $132,000
- Death benefit: $580,000
- Outstanding loans: $0

Per Robert's instructions, ownership of both policies transferred to David — his son, their father. David could now decide whether to continue paying premiums, transfer ownership to the grandchildren themselves, or use the policies as collateral for family needs.

Robert also had a small whole life policy of his own — one he'd started decades earlier, before he understood IBC, before the term even existed. Death benefit: $180,000. That money passed to Patricia as the named beneficiary.

But here's what Patricia did with it.

At 81, she wasn't interested in spending $180,000 on herself. Her needs were simple. Her expenses were covered by Social Security and Robert's pension survivor benefit. So she took $120,000 of that death benefit and did what Robert would have done: she put it to work.

She funded new policies on her two great-grandchildren — Emma's daughter (age 3) and Jackson's son (age 1). Each policy received $60,000 deposited into a Premium Deposit Fund Rider, which would pay premiums over ten years while earning a compounded discount.

Four generations. The system didn't skip a beat.

### The Family Balance Sheet: Year 15

| Policy | Insured (Age) | Owner | Annual Premium | Death Benefit | Cash Value |
|--------|---------------|-------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Policy A | David (57) | David | $42,000 | $1,680,000 | $685,000 |
| Policy B | Sarah (54) | Sarah | $18,000 | $820,000 | $285,000 |
| Policy C | Emma (27) | David | $8,000 | $520,000 | $148,000 |
| Policy D | Jackson (23) | David | $8,000 | $580,000 | $132,000 |
| Policy E | Great-grandchild 1 (3) | Patricia | ~$6,000* | $240,000 | $18,000 |
| Policy F | Great-grandchild 2 (1) | Patricia | ~$6,000* | $260,000 | $12,000 |
| **Total** | | | **$88,000** | **$4,100,000** | **$1,280,000** |

*Premiums paid from Premium Deposit Fund Rider

Fifteen years in. Four generations covered. $4.1 million in death benefit protecting the family. $1.28 million in accessible capital available for financing, opportunities, and emergencies.

And the system was just getting started.

## Year 25: David Transfers Ownership

David is now 67. He's sold the flooring business — used policy loans to bridge the transition period, then repaid them from the sale proceeds. His policy has become his retirement vehicle.

Emma is 37. Married. Two kids. Running a successful interior design firm. Jackson is 33. Single. Software engineer. Saves aggressively but didn't fully understand what his grandfather had started until his father sat him down and explained it.

David makes a decision: it's time to transfer ownership of the grandchildren's policies to the grandchildren themselves.

**Emma receives Policy C:**
- Cash value: $312,000
- Death benefit: $720,000
- Her annual premium responsibility: $8,000 (or she can let the policy run on dividends alone)

**Jackson receives Policy D:**
- Cash value: $285,000
- Death benefit: $780,000
- His annual premium responsibility: $8,000 (or he can let the policy run on dividends alone)

Neither Emma nor Jackson paid for these policies. Their grandfather funded them for 15 years. Their father funded them for 10 more. Now they inherit a banking system worth over half a million combined — with decades of compounding still ahead.

But here's the real gift: David didn't just hand over assets. He handed over understanding.

He sat with each of them — separately, deliberately — and walked through the numbers. He showed them the original illustrations from 2010. He showed them how Robert had thought about trees and time and generations. He taught them the philosophy underneath the structure.

Emma started a policy on her oldest daughter that same year. Jackson committed to increasing his own premium by $5,000 annually. The system expanded.

### Year 25 Balance Sheet

| Policy | Insured (Age) | Owner | Death Benefit | Cash Value |
|--------|---------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Policy A | David (67) | David | $2,100,000 | $1,420,000 |
| Policy B | Sarah (64) | Sarah | $1,050,000 | $580,000 |
| Policy C | Emma (37) | Emma | $720,000 | $312,000 |
| Policy D | Jackson (33) | Jackson | $780,000 | $285,000 |
| Policy E | Great-grandchild 1 (13) | Patricia* | $380,000 | $86,000 |
| Policy F | Great-grandchild 2 (11) | David* | $420,000 | $74,000 |
| Policy G | Emma's daughter (5) | Emma | $180,000 | $28,000 |
| **Total** | | | **$5,630,000** | **$2,785,000** |

*Patricia graduated in Year 22; ownership transferred to David

The family now had nearly $2.8 million in accessible capital and $5.6 million in death benefit — distributed across seven policies, four generations, and multiple ownership structures. No single point of failure. No dependence on market returns. No anxiety about inheritance taxes or probate delays.

## Year 50: The Harvest Begins

Fast forward to 2060.

David graduated at 82. Sarah followed two years later at 81. Their death benefits — $2.4 million and $1.2 million respectively — passed to their children income-tax-free. Not as lump sums to be spent and forgotten, but as capital to be deployed within the family banking system.

Emma, now 62, used a portion of her inheritance to fund policies on her grandchildren — Robert's great-great-grandchildren. The names are different. The principle is identical.

Jackson, now 58, finally married at 45 and has a 12-year-old son. The boy already has a policy funded by three generations of Mitchells who came before him.

### The Numbers at 50 Years

Here's what the original four policies became — the ones started in 2010 on David, Sarah, Emma, and Jackson:

| Original Policy | Insured | Current Status | Final/Current Death Benefit | Final/Current Cash Value |
|-----------------|---------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Policy A | David | Graduated (82) | $2,400,000 paid to heirs | N/A |
| Policy B | Sarah | Graduated (84) | $1,200,000 paid to heirs | N/A |
| Policy C | Emma (62) | Active | $1,180,000 | $890,000 |
| Policy D | Jackson (58) | Active | $1,280,000 | $820,000 |

Emma's policy — the one Robert started with $8,000/year when she was 12 — now has $890,000 in cash value and $1.18 million in death benefit. She never paid the full premium herself; dividends have been covering it for fifteen years. She draws $45,000 annually in tax-advantaged retirement income and still watches the cash value grow.

Jackson's policy shows similar numbers: $820,000 in cash value, $1.28 million in death benefit. He's still paying some premium — he likes watching the numbers grow. He takes occasional policy loans for real estate investments and pays them back on his own schedule.

### The Generational Impact

Add the newer policies — the ones funded by death benefits from Patricia, David, and Sarah — and the family system now includes twelve active policies across five generations. Total death benefit: approximately $14 million. Total accessible cash value: approximately $6.5 million.

All from a decision made in 2010 by a retired electrical engineer who read a book about a forester in Alabama.

## Year 75: What the Forest Looks Like

It's 2085.

Emma graduated at 87. Her death benefit — $1.4 million — passed to her children, who had been raised on the philosophy. They knew what to do with it.

Jackson is 83. Still alive. Still teaching the next generation. His original policy — started when he was 8 years old — has been compounding for 75 years. Cash value: $3.2 million. Death benefit: $4.8 million.

But Jackson's policy is just one tree in a forest.

The Mitchell family banking system now includes:

- **23 active policies** across six generations
- **$42 million in combined death benefit**
- **$18 million in combined accessible cash value**
- **Zero debt to outside institutions**

Every car has been financed internally. Every business startup. Every emergency. Every opportunity.

When someone graduates, their death benefit doesn't disappear into spending. It funds the next round of policies. It capitalizes the next generation's banking system. It plants trees that will shade great-grandchildren not yet born.

### The Compounding Reality

Here's what most people miss about compounding: it's not about rate of return. It's about uninterrupted growth.

The stock market might average 7% over fifty years. But that average includes years of negative returns — 2008, 2020, 2022. Every down year breaks the compound chain. You're not compounding from the high point; you're recovering from the low.

Whole life cash value cannot go down. Ever. It must increase every year — that's a mathematical consequence of the policy structure. When dividends flow into paid-up additions, they add to that growth. Year after year. Without interruption.

Jackson's policy didn't grow to $3.2 million because of high returns. It grew because nothing ever interrupted the growth. Seventy-five years of steady accumulation, with every year building on the year before.

That's the forestry principle made financial.

## The System, Not the Product

Here's what the Mitchells understood that most families never learn:

**Your money must reside somewhere.**

Right now, today, your capital is sitting in an institution you don't own, earning returns you don't control, governed by rules you didn't write. When you need that money — for a car, for equipment, for opportunity, for emergency — you'll ask permission from someone who doesn't know you and doesn't care about your goals.

The Mitchells built a different structure. They built a warehouse they owned. They stocked the shelves. They taught their children how to run the store. And when each generation passes the keys to the next, the shelves are fuller than when they started.

Nelson Nash wrote that the process of building your system is more important than the size of the initial deposit. What matters is that you start.

Robert Mitchell started at 68 with a book and a question. Seventy-five years later, his great-great-grandchildren are living in the shade of trees he planted.

**That's the real case study.**

Not the numbers — though the numbers matter. Not the policy designs — though the designs matter. The case study is the decision. The decision to think long-range. To act on behalf of people you'll never meet. To plant a forest that will outlive everyone currently standing in it.

The best time to start a family banking system was three generations ago.

The second-best time is now.

## Summary: Key Numbers Across 75 Years

| Milestone | Year | Total Premiums Paid | Total Cash Value | Total Death Benefit |
|-----------|------|--------------------|-----------------:|-------------------:|
| Year 1 | 2010 | $76,000 | $54,600 | $2,320,000 |
| Year 10 | 2020 | $760,000 | $750,000 | $2,960,000 |
| Year 15 | 2025 | $1,100,000 | $1,280,000 | $4,100,000 |
| Year 25 | 2035 | $1,900,000 | $2,785,000 | $5,630,000 |
| Year 50 | 2060 | $4,200,000 | $6,500,000 | $14,000,000 |
| Year 75 | 2085 | $7,800,000 | $18,000,000 | $42,000,000 |

**Total premiums paid over 75 years:** ~$7.8 million
**Total death benefits paid to family:** ~$8.2 million
**Remaining cash value:** ~$18 million
**Remaining death benefit:** ~$42 million

The family received more in death benefits alone than they ever paid in premiums — and still have $18 million in accessible capital and $42 million in future death benefit.

That's what happens when capital compounds uninterrupted across generations.
