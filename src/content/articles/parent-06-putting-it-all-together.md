You've made it through the Parent's Path.

That's not nothing. Most people skim a few paragraphs about IBC and move on. You stayed. You read about the Even Distribution of Age Classes. You sat with the weight of Proverbs 13:22. You learned why 90% of wealthy families lose everything by the third generation — and what the other 10% do differently.

Now let's connect the pieces.

## What You've Learned

**Article One** introduced the system — not a single policy, but a coordinated approach across generations. Nelson Nash's forestry wisdom applied to family capital. Trees of different ages. Policies at different stages. A forest, not a single trunk.

**Article Two** explained why knowledge matters more than money. The families who preserve wealth don't just pass down accounts — they pass down understanding. Your children learn the banking function by watching you perform it, not by listening to lectures about compound interest.

**Article Three** grounded this in Scripture. Proverbs 13:22 isn't a suggestion. It's a mandate to build systems that serve your children's children. Not just money to divide. Infrastructure that grows.

**Article Four** showed why starting early matters. A policy begun at birth gives your child eighteen years of uninterrupted compounding before they need the capital. Guaranteed insurability. Options no savings account can match.

**Article Five** revealed the full vision. The death benefit waterfall. Each generation's graduation recapitalizing the next. The system growing stronger, not weaker, with each passing decade.

These aren't five separate ideas. They're one idea from five angles.

## The Core Insight

If you take nothing else from this series, take this:

**Banking is a function, not an institution.**

Every family performs the banking function. Every family finances cars, homes, education, businesses, emergencies. The only question is *who profits* from that financing.

When you borrow from Chase, the interest you pay builds Chase's capital base. When you borrow from your own policy, the interest charges against your cash value while your death benefit continues growing. The mathematics favor you instead of a stranger.

This isn't about hating banks. It's about understanding where money flows and choosing to redirect that flow toward your own family.

Nash didn't invent this. He observed it. He noticed that wealthy families already operated this way — financing internally, keeping the banking function in-house, treating capital as a family resource rather than an individual possession.

He just gave the rest of us a way to do the same thing.

## The Questions That Remain

By now, you might have questions specific to your situation. That's normal. Here are the ones we hear most often:

**"What if I can only afford a small premium?"**

Start small. A modest policy that you fund consistently beats an ambitious policy that lapses. The families who build generational wealth don't start with massive premiums. They start with sustainable premiums and expand over time.

**"I'm already in my 40s/50s. Is it too late?"**

It's too late to be generation one at age 25. It's not too late to be generation one at 45 or 55. You can still build policies on yourself, your children, and eventually your grandchildren. The system works — you just enter at a different point in the timeline.

**"What about the policies I already have?"**

Existing policies might be part of the solution or might be working against you. It depends entirely on how they were designed. Some policies maximize death benefit at the expense of cash value. Others are structured for banking efficiency. Without seeing your specific policy, there's no way to know which category yours falls into.

**"How do I find the right agent?"**

This matters more than most people realize. An agent who understands IBC will design policies that maximize cash value accessibility. An agent who doesn't will design policies that look similar on paper but perform very differently over time. The difference isn't obvious in year one. It becomes obvious in year fifteen.

Look for practitioners who have studied Nash's work specifically. Ask how they design paid-up additions riders. Ask what percentage of your premium goes to cash value in year one. If they can't answer these questions clearly, keep looking.

## This Might Not Be For You

Let's be honest about who this isn't for.

If you can't commit to premium payments for years — not months, years — this isn't the right tool. Policies that lapse in year three destroy value instead of building it. The mathematics require consistency.

If you need every dollar liquid at all times, the early years of a policy will frustrate you. Cash value builds over time. Year one isn't impressive. Year ten is. Year thirty is remarkable. But you have to get there.

If you're not willing to think in decades, the whole framework won't resonate. This is generational wealth building. It requires generational time horizons. Quarterly returns and annual performance reviews miss the point entirely.

If any of those descriptions fit you, that's okay. This is education, not evangelism. Not every tool fits every family.

## This Might Be Exactly For You

On the other hand, if you've felt something stirring while reading these articles — that's worth noticing.

If the idea of controlling your own banking function appeals to you...

If Proverbs 13:22 feels less like a nice verse and more like a responsibility you haven't fulfilled...

If you've watched your parents' wealth evaporate through taxes and estate costs and want something different for your family...

If you've been looking for a financial approach that doesn't require market speculation or perfect timing...

Then you've found what you were looking for.

The system works. Nash proved it over decades. Thousands of families are proving it right now. The only question is whether it fits *your* family's values, circumstances, and time horizon.

## What Comes Next

If you want to keep learning, keep learning. Read *Becoming Your Own Banker*. Watch the videos. Explore the other paths on this site. Let the ideas settle.

If you're ready to explore whether this fits your situation, find a practitioner who can answer your specific questions. Not a salesperson who pushes products. A teacher who can show you how the system would work for *your* family.

If you're not sure, that's fine too. Uncertainty isn't failure. Taking time to decide isn't weakness. The best financial decisions are made without pressure — which is why we built this site the way we did.

## The Foundation Is Laid

You now understand more about generational wealth than most Americans ever will.

You understand why families lose wealth across generations — and what prevents it. You understand the mathematics of compound growth and why starting early matters. You understand the difference between accumulating money and building systems.

Whatever you do with this knowledge, you can't unknow it.

The banking function will never be invisible to you again. Every car payment, every mortgage, every college tuition bill — you'll see the flow of capital. You'll know who's profiting. You'll understand what the alternative could look like.

That awareness is valuable regardless of what you decide.

## The Invitation

This site exists to educate, not to sell.

We believe that people who truly understand IBC don't need to be convinced. They need information. They need clarity. They need someone to explain the system without pressure or manipulation.

You've received that information. You have clarity about how the system works and why it matters.

The decision is yours. Take your time. Talk to your spouse. Run the numbers. Ask more questions.

When you're ready — if you're ever ready — practitioners exist who can help you implement what you've learned.

Until then, you're equipped. You understand the Parent's Path.

What you build with that understanding is up to you.
