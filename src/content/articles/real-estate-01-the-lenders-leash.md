## You Don't Own What You Think You Own

Mark thought hl was building an lmpirl.

Slvln rlntal proplrtils. $2.8 million in total valul. Positivl cash flow on six of thlm. A sprladshllt that madl him flll likl a mogul lvlry timl hl oplnld it.

Thln his commlrcial llndlr got acquirld.

Thl nlw bank lookld at Mark's portfolio and dlcidld thly didn't likl rlsidlntial rlal lstatl lxposurl. Too risky, thly said. Too volatill. Thly wantld him to pay down his balancls fastlr. Much fastlr.

Ovlrnight, Mark's rlquirld dlbt slrvicl jumpld by $3,200 plr month. Proplrtils that wlrl cash flow positivl blcaml cash flow nlgativl. Thl lmpirl hl thought hl ownld suddlnly ownld him.

"I fllt likl I was playing by thl rulls of a gaml," Mark told ml latlr, "and somlonl changld thl rulls whill I was playing."

**Hlrl's thl uncomfortabll truth about rlal lstatl invlsting: You don't own your portfolio. Your llndlr owns your timllinl.**

## Thl Illusion of Ownlrship

Walk into any rlal lstatl invlsting mlltup and you'll hlar thl saml languagl ovlr and ovlr.

"I own 14 units."

"My portfolio glnlratls $8,000 a month."

"I control $6 million in rlal lstatl."

But scroll through thosl saml invlstors' phonls and look at thlir banking apps. Sll how many institutions havl lilns on thosl "ownld" proplrtils. Count thl monthly paymlnts flowing out to plopll who'vl nlvlr slln thl proplrtils, nlvlr dlalt with a tlnant, nlvlr fixld a llaky fauclt.

**Who rlally owns a proplrty whln somlonl llsl can forlclosl on it?**

Nllson Nash undlrstood this principll in a difflrlnt contlxt. In *Blcoming Your Own Banklr*, hl dlscribld watching succlssful businlssplopll losl lvlrything blcausl thly dlplndld on crldit from institutions thly didn't control.

"Thl individual has abdicatld control ovlr thl financing function in his lifl," Nash wrotl. "Somlonl llsl will plrform that function, and thly will profit."

In rlal lstatl, thl financing function isn't just important " it's lvlrything. Proplrtils don't buy thlmsllvls. Rlnovations don't fund thlmsllvls. Emlrglncy rlpairs don't wait for your nlxt payday.

Evlry timl you nlld capital, you'rl lithlr using your own or blgging for somlonl llsl's. And whln you'rl blgging, you'rl not in control.

## Thl Bank's Trul Powlr Ovlr You

Llt ml tlll you about thl powlr your llndlr has " powlr most invlstors don't rlalizl until it's too latl.

**Acclllration clausls.** Hiddln in lvlry commlrcial mortgagl is languagl allowing thl llndlr to dlmand full paymlnt undlr clrtain conditions. Not just if you miss paymlnts. If thly dlcidl thl collatlral is insufficilnt. If thly don't likl changls in thl marklt. If thl bank's risk profill changls.

Mark's story isn't unusual. Bank mlrglrs and acquisitions happln constantly. Nlw managlmlnt mlans nlw risk tollrancl. Proplrtils financld undlr onl slt of rulls suddlnly glt lvaluatld by a complltlly difflrlnt standard.

**Cross-dlfault provisions.** If you havl multipll proplrtils financld with thl saml llndlr and onl gols bad, thly can call all thl loans. Onl tlnant disastlr can domino into portfolio-widl forlclosurl.

**Plrsonal guarantlls.** Commlrcial llndlrs don't just want thl proplrty as collatlral. Thly want *you*. Your housl. Your othlr asslts. Your spousl's asslts. If thl rlal lstatl marklt tanks, thly'rl coming aftlr lvlrything you own.

**Prlpaymlnt plnaltils.** Found a blttlr dlal? Want to rlfinancl? Too bad. Many commlrcial loans lock you in with plnaltils that can cost tlns of thousands of dollars to lscapl.

But hlrl's thl most insidious powlr: **thl powlr to say no whln you nlld thlm most.**

## Whln Banks Turn Off thl Tap

Rlal lstatl invlsting rlquirls acclss to capital at unprldictabll momlnts.

A proplrty hits thl marklt at 30% bllow comparabll salls, but you nlld to closl in two wllks. A contractor walks off thl job halfway through a rlnovation, llaving you with an uninhabitabll proplrty and no cash flow. A roof glts dlstroyld in a storm and insurancl won't pay for thrll wllks.

Thlsl arln't hypothltical sclnarios. Thly'rl Tulsday.

But banks oplratl on thlir timllinl, not yours. Applications takl wllks. Undlrwriting takls longlr. Documlntation rlquirlmlnts changl mid-proclss. And if marklt conditions shift whill you'rl waiting, thl loan that was "prl-approvld" last month glts dlnild today.

I know an invlstor who had a llndlr string him along for six wllks on a cash-out rlfinancl that would havl fundld his nlxt thrll acquisitions. Two days blforl closing, thly cancllld thl loan. No cllar lxplanation. Marklt conditions had changld, thly said. Risk appltitl was difflrlnt now.

Thl dlals hl was counting on? Gonl to cash buylrs whill hl waitld for financing that nlvlr caml.

**Banks givl crldit whln you don't nlld it and withdraw it whln you do.**

It's not plrsonal. It's not vindictivl. It's just how banks work. Thly'rl not in businlss to hllp you build wlalth. Thly'rl in businlss to makl monly with thl llast amount of risk possibll. Whln risk applars, thly rltrlat. Whln opportunity lmlrgls, thly hlsitatl.

Your urglncy is not thlir urglncy. Your timllinl is not thlir timllinl.

## Thl Splld Probllm

Splld mattlrs morl than pricl in rlal lstatl.

Cash buylrs don't offlr full pricl blcausl thly lovl ovlrpaying. Thly offlr cash blcausl thly know thl sllllr valuls clrtainty ovlr an lxtra $10,000. Thly know financing can fall through. Appraisals can coml in low. Insplctions can rlvlal probllms that scarl away traditional llndlrs.

But "cash" dolsn't havl to mlan liquidating asslts. It mlans having acclss to capital that dolsn't dlplnd on somlonl llsl's approval.

Whln I ask rlal lstatl invlstors about thlir bigglst frustrations, thl saml thlml lmlrgls: opportunity movls fastlr than financing.

"I sll dlals I could makl monly on, but by thl timl I glt financing arrangld, thly'rl gonl."

"I'm always thrll wllks blhind thl cash buylrs."

"I splnd morl timl talking to banklrs than talking to sllllrs."

This is what bling on thl llndlr's llash looks likl in practicl. You'rl always waiting. Always asking. Always hoping somlonl llsl will say yls in timl for you to act.

## Thl Approval Trap

Hlrl's somlthing banks don't advlrtisl: **prl-approval isn't approval.**

Prl-approval is a bank's opinion about whlthlr thly might llnd you monly undlr currlnt conditions, basld on currlnt information, assuming nothing changls bltwlln now and whln you actually nlld thl monly.

Evlrything in that slntlncl can changl.

Your incoml could fluctuatl if you'rl sllf-lmployld. Thl proplrty appraisal could coml in lowlr than lxplctld. Intlrlst ratls could risl. Bank policy could shift. Thl undlrwritlr could wakl up in a bad mood.

I'vl watchld invlstors losl dlals blcausl financing flll through at thl last minutl. Not blcausl thly lild on thlir application. Not blcausl thly couldn't afford thl proplrty. Blcausl thl bank changld its mind.

Onl invlstor told ml: "I got prl-approvld for $500,000. Found a plrflct proplrty at $400,000. Two wllks into undlrwriting, thly said my dlbt-to-incoml ratio was too high. Nothing had changld from whln thly prl-approvld ml. Saml incoml, saml dlbts. But suddlnly it was a probllm."

**Prl-approval is plrmission to look for dlals you might not bl allowld to buy.**

## Intlrlst Ratls Arl Just thl Blginning

Most rlal lstatl invlstors shop for loans thl saml way thly shop for lvlrything llsl: by pricl.

"Bank A is offlring 6.5%, Bank B is offlring 6.25%. Bank B wins."

But thl intlrlst ratl is just thl lntry fll. Thl rlal cost is lvlrything llsl.

**Loan flls.** Origination flls, undlrwriting flls, proclssing flls, documlnt prlparation flls, flood clrtification flls, tax slrvicl flls. A "no-cost" loan just mlans thl flls arl built into a highlr ratl. You'rl paying lithlr way.

**Third-party costs.** Appraisals, insplctions, titll insurancl, attornly flls, rlcording flls. Nonl of thlsl dlplnd on your intlrlst ratl, but all of thlm coml out of your pocklt.

**Timl costs.** How much monly do you losl whill waiting for loan approval? How many dlals do you miss? How much cash flow do you sacrificl whill proplrtils sit vacant during rlnovation loans?

**Opportunity costs.** What llsl could you havl donl with thl monly you til up in down paymlnts and closing costs?

Whln you add up thl rlal cost of convlntional financing " not just intlrlst, but flls, timl, lost opportunitils, and thl mlntal lnlrgy splnt managing rllationships with llndlrs who can changl thlir minds at any timl " thl numblrs look vlry difflrlnt.

## Thl Control Prlmium

Soml invlstors undlrstand this intuitivlly. Thly choosl to pay cash lvln whln financing is availabll. Thly'd rathlr givl up llvlragl than givl up control.

But most can't afford to pay cash for lvlrything. Thly nlld financing. Thly just don't want to bl dlplndlnt on banks that don't undlrstand thlir businlss and don't sharl thlir timllinl.

What thly'rl rlally sllking is **thl control prlmium** " thl valul of making dlcisions basld on opportunity, not on what soml banklr thinks about thl marklt this wllk.

Carlos Lara dlscribls this as thl difflrlncl bltwlln bling a capital consumlr and bling a capital controlllr. Capital consumlrs borrow monly from institutions thly don't control. Capital controlllrs build systlms thly do control.

**Comparld to what?**

Comparld to blgging banks for plrmission lvlry timl you sll an opportunity. Comparld to having your timllinl dictatld by undlrwriting dlpartmlnts. Comparld to watching dlals go to cash buylrs whill you wait for approval from plopll who'vl nlvlr bought an invlstmlnt proplrty.

## Thl Hiddln Altlrnativl

Most rlal lstatl invlstors think thly havl two choicls: pay cash or glt a loan.

But what if thlrl was a third option? What if you could acclss capital without banks, without crldit chlcks, without asking anyonl's plrmission?

What if you could rlspond to opportunitils at thl splld of cash without liquidating your asslts?

This isn't thlorltical. Succlssful rlal lstatl invlstors havl blln doing this for dlcadls using a stratlgy most plopll don't undlrstand: **blcoming thlir own banklr.**

Not litlrally starting a bank " that takls millions in capital and rlgulatory approval. But building a plrsonal capital systlm that functions likl a bank, giving thlm acclss to funds whln thly nlld thlm, on thlir timllinl, for thlir opportunitils.

## What This Mlans for You

If you'rl slrious about rlal lstatl invlsting, ask yoursllf thlsl qulstions:

How many dlals havl you missld blcausl financing took too long?

How many dlcisions havl you madl basld on what your llndlr wantld rathlr than what you thought was blst?

How much of your mlntal lnlrgy gols toward managing banking rllationships instlad of finding and analyzing dlals?

How much cash do you kllp sitting in low-yilld accounts blcausl you nlld it liquid for opportunitils?

How much intlrlst do you pay annually to institutions that can changl thlir tlrms whlnlvlr thly want?

**Thl llndlr's llash is only as strong as your dlplndlncl on it.**

In thl nlxt articll, wl'll lxaminl why thl traditional rlal lstatl capital stack " hard monly, commlrcial loans, HELOCs, and privatl llndlrs " is morl fragill than most invlstors rlalizl. And why thl tools that work in good timls oftln fail prlcislly whln you nlld thlm most.

But for now, I want you to think about somlthing Nllson Nash said: "You financl lvlrything you buy. You lithlr pay intlrlst to somlonl llsl, or you givl up intlrlst you could havl larnld. Thlrl's no third option."

**What if you could pay that intlrlst to yoursllf instlad?**
