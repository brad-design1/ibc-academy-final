## You Didn't Build This by Accident

You didn't build your business by accident. You took the risk. You did the work. While other people were updating their rÃ©sumÃ©s and hoping someone would pick them, you picked yourself.

Maybe you started with a truck and a phone. Maybe you started with a laptop and a kitchen table. Maybe you signed a lease you weren't sure you could afford and figured it out month by month.

However it happened"you built something. Revenue. Employees. Clients who trust you. A reputation.

Your business probably **is** your greatest wealth generator right now. And you should feel good about that. Most people never build anything. You did.

But let me ask you a question that might make you uncomfortable.

## The Standard Playbook (And What It's Missing)

If you've talked to an accountant or financial advisor"and you probably have"the advice sounds something like this:

**Max out the SEP-IRA.** You can stash up to 25% of net self-employment income. Good tax deduction. Money goes into the market. You don't touch it until you're 59Â½ or you pay a penalty.

**Reinvest profits.** Grow the business. Buy better equipment. Hire another person. Expand to a second location. The business itself is the investment.

**Build equity.** Make the business worth something so that someday"maybe in fifteen or twenty years"you can sell it. The exit is the payday.

This is the playbook. Virtually every business owner in America follows some version of it.

And it's not *wrong*, exactly. Tax deductions are real. Business growth is real. Building equity is real.

But let's think about what this playbook actually creates:

Your business generates the income. Your retirement account is funded by the business. Your growth capital comes from business profits. Your future wealth depends on eventually selling the business.

**Everything flows through one asset. Everything depends on one engine.**

If the business has a great year, everything's great. If the business has a bad year"or a bad quarter, or a bad month"everything tightens. Retirement contributions slow down. Growth stalls. The exit timeline stretches.

You've built a powerful wealth generator. But you've also built a **single point of failure**.

## The Function You're Giving Away

Here's what nobody tells you about being a successful business owner:

There's a function inside every business that generates enormous wealth. It's not the product you sell. It's not the service you provide. It's not even the revenue.

**It's the financing function.**

Your business needs capital constantly. New equipment. Replacement vehicles. Inventory. Expansion. Bridge financing between receivables. Emergency repairs.

And when those moments arrive, what do you do?

You go to the bank.

You fill out applications. You hand over tax returns. You explain your business to someone who's never worked in your industry. You wait for a committee to decide whether you deserve access to capital.

And if you get approved"which isn't guaranteed"**you pay interest**. Lots of it.

Think about it. You take the risk. You do the work. You generate the revenue. And then when you need capital to keep growing, you pay someone else for the right to use money.

Every time you finance equipment, the finance company profits. Every time you use a line of credit, the bank profits. Every time you lease a vehicle, the leasing company profits.

**They're profiting from the capital your business created.**

## Where Those Dollars Actually Go

Let me paint you a picture with real numbers.

Take a successful HVAC contractor I know. He replaces a service van every four years"$52,000 each time. Over a 20-year career, that's five vans. Financed at typical commercial rates, he'll pay roughly **$45,000 in interest** to the finance company.

Forty-five thousand dollars. That's not buying anything. That's not building anything. That's just rent on borrowed money, leaving his business permanently.

Or the chiropractor who finances $80,000 in equipment. Over five years at 8% interest, she pays **$17,800** that simply vanishes into someone else's quarterly earnings.

Add it up across a career. Equipment purchases. Vehicle replacements. Expansion capital. Bridge financing. The total interest most business owners pay to outside institutions is staggering.

**That money could have stayed inside your operation. Could have compounded for your family. Could have funded the next opportunity without asking anyone's permission.**

## The Question Nobody Asks

Here's what I want you to consider:

Your business generates wealth. But **who finances your business?**

Banks do. Finance companies do. Leasing companies do. And they all profit handsomely from the privilege.

You're not just a business owner. Whether you realize it or not, you're also a banking **customer**"and you're one of the bank's best customers. Reliable income. Constant capital needs. Repeat borrower.

The bank loves business owners like you. You're their favorite client.

The question is: **do you want to keep being their favorite client forever?**

---

## What's Really Your Greatest Asset?

Yes, your business generates wealth that most people will never create. That's real. That's valuable.

But there's something potentially more valuable that most business owners never consider:

**What if you could control the banking function in your life?**

What if, instead of paying Ford Credit $1,600 a month for that work truck, you paid yourself? What if, instead of begging for approval when opportunity knocks, you were the one with capital?

What if the financing function"the one that banks profit from"was owned and controlled by you?

Your business might be your greatest asset today. But the **banking function** could be worth even more over time.

Because here's the thing about the banking business:

It never goes away. People will always need capital. Businesses will always need financing. Equipment will always need replacing. Opportunities will always require quick access to money.

The question isn't whether the banking function will exist. The question is **who will profit from it**.

## Compared to What?

Before you dismiss this as unrealistic, ask yourself:

**Compared to what?**

Compared to hoping your SEP-IRA performs well for the next 20 years? Compared to putting all your eggs in the business basket? Compared to paying banks and finance companies hundreds of thousands in interest over your career?

What you've built is impressive. Your business is real wealth creation.

But maybe"just maybe"it's not your greatest asset.

Maybe your greatest asset is what you could build **with** your business. A system that captures the financing function instead of outsourcing it. A mechanism that compounds wealth while simultaneously providing access to capital.

**A system where you become the bank.**

---

**In the next article, we're going to talk about the cash flow problem nobody talks about.**

Not the kind where you can't make payroll. The other kind. The kind where your business is profitable, your life is comfortable, and yet somehow there's never enough capital sitting around when opportunity knocks.

That gap between "doing well" and "having capital on demand""that's where the real conversation starts.
