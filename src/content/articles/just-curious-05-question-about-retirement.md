# The Question Nobody Asks About Retirement

You're sitting across from a financial advisor. The retirement planning meeting.

He asks about your goals, timeline, risk tolerance. He shows you colorful charts going up and to the right. He talks about asset allocation and tax-advantaged accounts.

He asks **dozens of questions** about saving money for retirement.

**He never asks one question about spending money in retirement.**

**The question:** "What's your banking strategy?"

**Translation:** When you're 67 and need $25,000 for a new roof, how will you access that money without destroying your retirement plan?

This might be **the most important financial question of your life.**

And **nobody is asking it.**

## The Missing Half of Retirement Planning

Traditional retirement planning focuses entirely on **accumulation**.

How much should you save? What should you invest in? How big will your account be at 65?

**But accumulation is only half the puzzle.**

The other half—the half no one talks about—is **distribution**.

**How do you turn your retirement pile into spendable money?**

This isn't a simple question. And the answer determines whether your retirement plan actually works or destroys itself.

## David's $98,000 Problem

Meet David. He's 66 and just retired with $1.2 million in his 401(k). He followed the "4% rule"—withdrawing $48,000 per year should make his money last 30 years.

David feels good. **Until real life happens.**

**Year 1:** Furnace dies. Cost: $8,000.  
**Year 2:** Wife needs dental work: $12,000.  
**Year 3:** Roof replacement: $25,000.  
**Year 4:** New car needed: $35,000.  
**Year 5:** Medical specialist: $18,000.

<br />

**Five years, five unexpected expenses totaling $98,000.**

**Question:** Where does David get this money?

## The Broken Traditional Answer

**Financial Advisor:** "Just withdraw extra money from your 401(k) when you need it."

**Here's what actually happens when David needs that $25,000 roof:**

David's in a 22% tax bracket. To get $25,000 after taxes, he must withdraw **$32,051** from his 401(k).

If he withdraws during a market downturn, he's selling investments at the worst possible time. Money withdrawn during a crash can't recover when markets bounce back.

His $48,000 annual budget becomes $80,051. His "30-year money" becomes "18-year money."

Higher withdrawals trigger Medicare premium increases—his $165/month premium jumps to $395/month for life.

**One $25,000 roof repair costs David $7,000 in extra taxes plus $2,760 per year in higher Medicare premiums.**

**A $25,000 expense became a $40,000+ expense that compounds annually.**

## The 4% Rule Fantasy

The "4% rule" assumes you'll withdraw exactly 4% every year for 30 years straight.

**When has anyone's life worked that way?**

Real life has home repairs, medical emergencies, market crashes, family needs, and inflation spikes.

<br />

**The 4% rule works perfectly in spreadsheets.** It fails in real life because **real life doesn't follow a budget.**

**Ryan Griggs** puts it bluntly: "Conventional retirement planning is code for gambling."

It bets that markets will cooperate, you'll never need extra money, and sequence of returns won't destroy your plan.

**That's not planning. That's hoping.**

## The Banking Question Revealed

"What's your banking strategy?" means: **How will you access capital during retirement without triggering taxes, penalties, or market timing risks?**

**Traditional retirement planning has no good answer.**

- 401(k) withdrawals are **taxable income**
- IRA withdrawals are **taxable income**  
- Brokerage accounts trigger **capital gains taxes**
- CDs mature on **their schedule**, not yours
- Savings accounts offer access but **lose purchasing power** to inflation

<br />

**Every traditional retirement vehicle has the same flaw:** You cannot access your money when you need it, in the amount you need, without negative consequences.

**That's not a retirement plan. That's a retirement trap.**

## The Life Insurance Solution

Here's what the retirement planning industry doesn't want you to know:

**Life insurance companies solved the banking question 200 years ago.**

When you have properly structured whole life insurance, you can access capital through **policy loans** with none of the problems that destroy traditional retirement plans:

- **No taxes:** Policy loans aren't taxable income
- **No penalties:** Access your capital anytime for any reason  
- **No market timing risk:** Loan amounts aren't dependent on market values
- **No qualification:** No credit checks or approval required
- **No mandatory repayment:** Pay back on your schedule, or not at all

<br />

**Policy loans give you immediate access to capital without destroying your wealth-building vehicle.**

But almost nobody knows this because financial advisors don't understand life insurance, and the retirement planning industry profits from keeping your money trapped.

## The Sequence of Returns Killer

**Sequence of returns risk** is the biggest threat to traditional retirement plans.

If you retire right before a market crash, you're forced to sell investments at depressed prices to generate income. Money sold at the bottom can't recover.

**Example:** Two retirees, both start with $1 million, both withdraw $50,000/year.

**Retiree A** retires in 1999, right before the dot-com crash.  
**Retiree B** retires in 2010, after the crash recovery begins.

**Same money, same withdrawals, same long-term returns.**

**Retiree A runs out of money in 18 years.**  
**Retiree B's money lasts 35+ years.**

**The only difference was retirement timing.**

This is traditional retirement planning's **fundamental flaw**: Your plan's success depends entirely on factors you cannot control.

**Policy loans eliminate sequence of returns risk** because loan amounts aren't dependent on market performance.

## The Real Strategy

Once you understand the banking question, **a different retirement strategy emerges:**

**Phase 1:** Build wealth in vehicles that give you **access and growth**  
**Phase 2:** Access capital through loans **without** triggering taxes  
**Phase 3:** Repay loans if it makes sense, or let them ride  
**Phase 4:** Pass remaining wealth to heirs without probate complications

<br />

**David's roof example revisited:**

**Traditional:** Withdraw $32,051 from 401(k), pay $7,051 in taxes, trigger higher Medicare premiums, accelerate depletion.

**Banking:** Take $25,000 policy loan, no taxes, no penalties, no disruption. Pay back over time or let it reduce future death benefit.

**One approach costs $40,000+. The other costs $25,000.**

## Control vs. Being Controlled

**"What's your banking strategy?"** is really asking: **Do you control your capital, or does it control you?**

**Traditional retirement accounts control you:**
- Dictate when you can access money (age 59½)
- Dictate required withdrawals (RMDs at age 73)
- Dictate tax consequences (ordinary income rates)  
- Impose penalties for early access
- Make market timing determine your success

<br />

**Banking-based strategies let you control capital:**
- Access money anytime for any reason
- Take as much or as little as you need
- No tax consequences for access
- No penalties ever
- Market timing irrelevant to capital access

## Why Nobody Asks This Question

**Financial advisors** don't ask because they don't have a good answer. Their industry is built around accumulation, not distribution.

**The retirement planning industry** doesn't ask because they profit from keeping your money trapped in accounts that charge fees for decades.

**Most people don't ask because they don't know the question exists.**

But now you know.

**Now you can't unknow it.**

## The Final Piece

You've seen where your money goes. You've seen the silent partner in every purchase. You've seen how savings accounts work against you. You've seen what banks do with your money.

Now you've seen the question nobody asks about retirement.

**There's one final piece to the puzzle:**

**What if you were the bank?**

What if you could capture the profits that currently flow to financial institutions?

What if you could solve all these problems with **one elegant system?**

That's what we'll explore next.
