# The Banking Function: A Path to Financial Freedom

Nelson Nash said something that sounds simple but carries the weight of a lifetime's observation:

** — When you know what's going on, you'll know what to do."**

That's not motivational fluff. It's a statement about the relationship between perception and action. Most people don't lack the ability to build wealth. They lack the ability to *see* what's happening to their money. Once you see it—really see it—the path forward becomes obvious.

But first, you have to recognize the shackles.

## The Invisible Prison

Here's a number that should disturb you: **34.5 cents of every dollar you earn goes to interest payments.**

Not to taxes. Not to living expenses. Not to savings. To *interest*—paid to institutions you don't own, for money you supplied in the first place.

Nelson Nash calculated this by studying the cash flow of what he called the "All-American family." A working person earning a reasonable income, doing everything the financial experts recommend. Twenty percent to transportation. Thirty percent to housing. Forty-five percent to living expenses. Maybe five to ten percent left over for savings.

And threading through every category—car payments, mortgages, credit cards, student loans, furniture financing—a constant bleed of interest flowing outward. The total: roughly a third of every dollar earned, for an entire working lifetime.

This ratio doesn't improve with age. It's not a phase. It's not something you grow out of. For most Americans, this proportion stays constant from their first car loan to their last mortgage payment.

Here's the part that should make you angry: while this is happening, your financial advisor has you obsessing over getting an extra two percent return on the tiny sliver of income you manage to save.

You're fighting for basis points on savings while hemorrhaging dollars on financing. It's like trying to fill a bathtub with the drain wide open.

## The Headwind

Nash was a pilot for over fifty years. He understood something about movement that most people never think about.

An airplane doesn't fly through a vacuum. It flies through an environment. And that environment can work with you or against you.

Picture this: you're flying from Birmingham to Chicago in a small plane that cruises at 100 miles per hour. But you're heading into a 345 mph headwind.

What happens?

Your airspeed indicator says 100 mph. You're burning fuel. You're pointing your nose at Chicago. But your ground speed—your actual progress—is negative 245 mph. You're moving toward Miami. Despite everything you're doing, you're going backward.

That's what the typical financial path looks like. You're earning. You're saving. You're following the advice of experts. And you're losing a third of every dollar to third-party lenders without even knowing it.

The headwind is invisible. The bleed is invisible. The chains are invisible. And because you can't see them, you keep flying into the wind, wondering why you never seem to get ahead.

## The Moment of Recognition

Nash didn't discover this truth in a classroom. He discovered it on his knees.

November 1980. His first grandchild is born. Two months later, his 52-year-old brother drops dead from a heart attack. Five months after that, a second granddaughter arrives—and is diagnosed with cancer at six weeks old. Meanwhile, interest rates hit 23 percent.

Nash owed half a million dollars at those rates. That's $115,000 a year in interest alone. He had done everything the financial gurus told him to do. Buy real estate. Use leverage. Other people's money. Debt is good if you can deduct it.

Now he was drowning.

He describes those months as a time when "the quality and quantity of your prayer life increases dramatically." At 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., in the kneeling position, he prayed for a way out.

The answer, he said, came "like a baseball bat across the eyes."

*You are standing in the midst of everything it takes to get out—but you don't see it because you look at things like everyone else.*

That's the first step to freedom: *recognition*. You have to see that you're shackled before you can break the chains. You have to understand that the headwind exists before you can turn it into a tailwind.

Nash realized he had whole life insurance policies that gave him contractual access to capital at 5 to 8 percent. Had he capitalized those policies earlier, he could have refinanced 23 percent debt into single-digit rates. Had he taken the banking function seriously from the start, he never would have been cornered by third-party lenders in the first place.

The lifeboat had been there all along. He just couldn't see it.

## What Freedom Actually Means

Let me tell you what financial freedom doesn't mean. It doesn't mean "no more work." It doesn't mean passive income streaming in while you sleep on a beach. That's fantasy, not strategy.

Financial freedom means *control*. Control over the flow of money through your life. Control over the financing function that touches every major purchase you'll ever make. Control over access to capital when opportunity or crisis arrives.

Think about what happens when you need $50,000. For a car. For equipment. For an emergency. For a business opportunity that won't wait.

In the conventional system, you sit down with a loan officer. You provide tax returns, pay stubs, credit scores. You wait for underwriting. You sign documents that say if you miss payments, they take your collateral. Maybe you get the loan. Maybe you don't. You won't know until someone else decides.

That's dependency. That's asking permission to use resources you earned.

Now consider the alternative. You call an insurance company. You say you need $50,000. They ask for your mailing address. No credit check. No income verification. No questions about what you're doing with the money. No mandatory repayment schedule.

The difference isn't just convenience. It's the difference between being a supplicant and being an owner. Between asking for permission and exercising a right.

## Turning the Headwind Into a Tailwind

Remember the airplane analogy?

Most people stop at the moment they escape the headwind. They think calm air is the ultimate situation. No wind. No resistance. Just their own 100 mph of forward progress.

Nash called this the "arrival syndrome." The belief that you can't do any better.

But have patience. Let the high-pressure system continue to move. Now you have a 345 mph tailwind. Plus your own 100 mph. Your ground speed is 445 mph.

Here's what most people miss entirely: the real comparison isn't between you and calm air. It's between you and everyone else.

Ninety-five percent of Americans are flying into a 345 mph headwind. They're losing a third of every dollar to interest. They're going backward without knowing it.

If you control the banking function—if you turn that headwind into a tailwind—the difference between you and them isn't 345 mph. It's 690 mph. Twice the wind speed. The entire environment has reversed.

Nash wrote: "Most people in this situation concentrate all their attention on trying to make the airplane go 105 miles per hour. They would do well to spend their energy instead on controlling the environment in which they fly."

You can't control the weather in the airplane world. But you can in the financial world. That's what makes this possible.

## The Banking Function Is Already Happening

Here's something critical to understand: banking is already happening in your life. Every single day.

Every car payment is banking. Every mortgage payment is banking. Every credit card swipe is banking. Every time you pay cash—giving up the interest that money could have earned—that's banking too.

You can't escape the banking function. It's woven into the fabric of economic life. Money flows from the pool, through your hands, to meet your needs, and back to the banking system. The cycle never stops.

The only question is: *who profits from it?*

When you borrow from a bank, they profit. When you pay with a credit card, the credit card company profits. When you finance equipment through a dealer, the finance company profits. They all understand the banking function. They've built empires on it.

Nash's thesis—the sentence that holds everything together—is this:

*"You finance everything you buy. Either you pay interest to someone else, or you give up the interest you could have earned."* — Nelson Nash

There is no third option. There is no escape from financing. The only question is which side of the equation you're on.

## Knowing What to Do

Once you see what's going on, you know what to do.

You stop feeding capital to institutions you don't own. You start building your own pool of capital—contractually protected, growing without interruption, accessible without permission. You run your financing through a system where the interest payments recirculate back to you instead of disappearing into someone else's profit margin.

This isn't complicated. It's just invisible until someone shows you.

The chains are made of ignorance. They dissolve the moment you see them clearly.

Nash spent the rest of his life teaching this concept because he understood what it meant. Not just financially—though the financial implications are profound. But in terms of human freedom. The ability to act without asking permission. The ability to seize opportunity without waiting for approval. The ability to weather crisis without depending on institutions that might close their doors exactly when you need them most.

That's what reclaiming the banking function really means. It's not a product. It's not an investment. It's a change in the architecture of your financial life.

The first step is recognition.

The second step is decision.

The third step is action sustained over time—building, capitalizing, and running the banking function through your own system instead of someone else's.

When you know what's going on, you'll know what to do.

Now you know what's going on.

What will you do?
